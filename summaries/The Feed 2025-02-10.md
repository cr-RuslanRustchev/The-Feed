## Coyote Banking Trojan: A Stealthy Attack via LNK Files
### Summary
The Coyote Banking Trojan is delivered through **multi-stage attacks initiated by LNK files**, primarily targeting users in Brazil to harvest sensitive information from financial applications and websites. Once deployed, the Trojan performs keylogging, captures screenshots, and displays phishing overlays to steal credentials. The malware modifies the registry to establish persistence and gathers system information to send to a remote server. The Trojan expands its target list to include numerous sites and financial agents and monitors active windows.

### Technical Details
![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-02-10_1.jpg>)
The attack begins with a malicious LNK file containing a PowerShell command that connects to a remote server. This command initiates the next stage by running a script from a URL such as hxxps://tbet[.]geontrigame[.]com/zxchzzmism. The downloaded content contains encoded data segments which are decoded and executed using PowerShell scripts.

*   The **decoded data leads to the injection of a DLL file** ("bmwiMcDec") that acts as a loader, using VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory to inject a payload ("npuGDec"). It then uses CreateRemoteThread to execute the injected code.
*   The injected code uses **Donut** to decrypt and execute MSIL payloads.
*   Persistence is achieved by modifying the registry at “HCKU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run”. The malware removes any existing PowerShell commands and creates a new one with a randomly generated name, pointing to a Base64-encoded URL.
*   The malware gathers system information (machine name, username, OS) and installed antivirus products, encodes it in Base64, reverses the string, and sends it to a remote server.
*   The Trojan checks for specific usernames and virtual machine-related files/folders to identify test/sandbox environments.
*   Coyote monitors active windows, and if a target site is accessed, it communicates with a C2 server via port 443 using domains like geraatualiza[.]com, masterdow[.]com, and geraupdate[.]com. It can receive commands to perform actions such as taking screenshots, keylogging, or displaying fake images.

### Countries
*   Brazil

### Industries
*   Financial

### Recommendations
*   Utilize FortiGuard Antivirus, FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR with up-to-date protections.
*   Block the identified C2 server using FortiGuard Web Filtering Service.
*   Complete Fortinet’s free cybersecurity training module: Fortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF) in Cybersecurity to help identify and protect against phishing attacks.
*   Contact the Global FortiGuard Incident Response Team if an impact is suspected.

### Hunting methods
*   Analyze LNK files for unusual PowerShell commands.
*   Monitor registry modifications at “HCKU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” for new or altered PowerShell commands.
*   Inspect network traffic for connections to the listed URLs and hosts.
*   Examine processes for the use of Donut to decrypt and execute MSIL payloads.

## Operation Phantom Circuit: North Korea's Global Data Exfiltration Campaign
### Summary
The Lazarus Group, based in North Korea, conducted a sophisticated campaign called "Phantom Circuit," **compromising over 1,500 systems worldwide**. The attackers infiltrated trusted development tools by embedding malware directly into them. They targeted cryptocurrency and technology developers, exfiltrating sensitive development credentials, authentication tokens, browser-stored passwords, and system configuration details. The stolen data was transferred to Dropbox after collection by command-and-control (C2) servers. The infrastructure included command-and-control servers, spoofed domains, and persistent remote management sessions. The operation was active from November 2024 to January 2025, with major victim hotspots in Europe, India, and Brazil. The attackers used **Russian proxy servers** to obfuscate their origin.

### Technical Details
The Lazarus Group employed a complex, multi-layered infrastructure to conduct "Operation Phantom Circuit":

*   **Initial Access**: The operation started from North Korean IP addresses.
*   **VPN Obfuscation**: These IPs connected to Astrill VPN endpoints to conceal their origin.
*   **Proxy Relay**: Traffic was routed through the Oculus Proxy network in Hasan, Russia, adding an extra layer of anonymity. These proxies are registered to Sky Freight Limited.
*   **Command and Control (C2) Servers**: The proxied connections reached C2 infrastructure hosted on Stark Industries servers, which managed communications with compromised systems and exfiltrated data. The C2 servers used ports 1224 for communication with infected systems and 1245 for a hidden administrative platform.
*   **Data Exfiltration**: Stolen data was uploaded to Dropbox. Some servers maintained active sessions for over five hours.
*   **Malware Embedding**: The attackers embedded malware into trusted development tools, ensuring widespread compromise while maintaining stealth.
*   **Administrative Platform**: The C2 servers included an administrative platform for managing compromised systems worldwide. This platform, built on Node.js with a React frontend, featured multiple API endpoints for granular operational control. It allowed operators to search, filter, and organize exfiltrated information.
*   **Persistence**: Attackers maintained persistent RDP sessions, some lasting up to 10 days, to retain direct access to compromised systems.

The administrative platform had key features for system tracking, credential management, and activity logs:

*   **System Tracking**: Monitored device details, including PC names, operating systems, and configurations.
*   **Credential Management**: Collected URLs, browser-stored credentials, and authentication tokens.
*   **Activity Logs**: Tracked timestamps for victim interactions.

The platform included hidden pages and access points, secured behind a login wall, to facilitate control over compromised systems. The Info page retrieved and displayed exfiltrated victim data, including PC names, URLs, passwords, credentials, and system configuration details. The backend extracted and filtered data from implants via the /keys API endpoint.

The Lazarus Group used a commercial proxy service (Oculus Proxy) to add a layer of legitimacy to their operations. Some of the Astrill VPNs used in this operation could be traced back to Pyongyang. STRIKE applied the CIA’s Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) methodology and concluded that the Lazarus Group was responsible for the campaign.

### Countries
*   **Targeted**: Primarily European technology sectors.
*   **Victim Hotspots**: India, Brazil.
*   **Origin**: North Korea.
*   **Proxy**: Russia.

### Industries

### Recommendations
*   **Package Verification**: Validate the integrity of software updates using cryptographic checksums or signatures.
*   **Network Monitoring**: Analyze connections to uncommon ports, such as 1224 and 1245.
*   **Proxy Detection**: Identify and block suspicious proxy usage, particularly from commercial services linked to malicious campaigns.
*   **Development Tool Audits**: Regularly review and update development tools to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
*   **Remote Access Scrutiny**: Monitor for persistent Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions that could indicate unauthorized access.
*   **Incident Response**: Contact the STRIKE Incident Response team.
*   **Supply Chain Security**: Use SecurityScorecard’s Supply Chain Detection and Response (SCDR) solution to monitor and assess the software supply chain.

### Hunting methods
*   Analyze network connections for traffic through Astrill VPNs and Oculus Proxy IPs to C2 servers.
*   Monitor for connections to ports 1224 and 1245.

## Persistent Threats from the Kimsuky Group Using RDP Wrapper - ASEC
### Summary
The Kimsuky group is actively launching attacks using spear-phishing emails with malicious shortcut files disguised as Office documents. When executed, these files use PowerShell or Mshta to download and execute payloads like **PebbleDash** and **RDP Wrapper**. They use these tools, along with others such as **Proxy, KeyLogger, and infostealers**, to control infected systems and steal information. The group has been modifying its tactics, such as using RDP Wrapper and Proxy tools for remote control rather than relying solely on backdoors. To avoid detection, they also extract key values from web browsers instead of directly stealing credentials.

### Technical Details
The Kimsuky group employs a range of techniques and tools in their attacks:

*   **Spear-Phishing**: Uses shortcut files (\*.LNK) disguised as Office documents delivered via spear-phishing emails to specific targets.
*   **Initial Payload Delivery**: Executes PowerShell or Mshta to download additional payloads from external sources.
*   **RDP Wrapper**: Installs a custom-made RDP Wrapper to enable remote desktop functionality on systems where it is not supported by default, creating export functions to bypass file detection.
*   **Proxy**: Uses proxy malware to enable external access to systems located on private networks, creating mutexes for operation.
*   **Keylogging**: Uses PowerShell scripts and executable keyloggers to record user keystrokes, storing the data in specific file paths.
*   **Credential Theft**: Employs tools like "forceCopy" to steal user credentials from web browsers, using the NTFS Parser library to read files and bypass security products.
*   **Loaders and Injectors**: Uses Loader and Injector malware, along with ReflectiveLoader PowerShell scripts, to load files into memory and inject code into target processes.
*   **Persistence**: Uses tools like RDP Wrapper and Proxy to maintain remote control over infected systems.

### Countries
*   **Targeted**: South Korea

### Industries
*   Not mentioned in the source.

### Recommendations
*   Carefully check the sender of emails and avoid opening files from unknown sources.
*   Apply the latest patches for programs, including the OS and web browsers.
*   Update AhnLab V3 to the latest version to prevent malware infection.

## Technical Analysis of Xloader Versions 6 and 7 | Part 1
### Summary
This article provides a detailed analysis of **Xloader versions 6 and 7**, focusing on its behavior, obfuscation, and anti-analysis techniques. Xloader establishes persistence by copying itself into a subdirectory under %APPDATA% or %PROGRAMFILES% and adding an entry in the Windows registry. It uses process injection techniques to evade antivirus software, injecting code into processes like explorer.exe and executables in the SysWOW64 directory. The malware employs multiple layers of custom encryption and obfuscation to protect its code and data. These versions have added new encryption layers and dynamic key generation to complicate analysis and detection.

### Technical Details
![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-02-07_2.png>)
![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-02-07_3.png>)
Xloader uses a multi-stage process to inject malicious code and maintain persistence:

*   **Persistence**: Xloader copies itself to %APPDATA% or %PROGRAMFILES% under a randomly named directory and file. It then creates a registry entry under either `HKCU` or `HKLM` in the `Run` or `Policies` key to ensure it runs on startup. The registry entry has a randomly generated name and points to the Xloader executable.
*   **Process Injection**:
    *   **Process Hollowing**: Xloader creates a new instance of itself via process hollowing.
    *   **Explorer.exe Injection**: It injects code into `explorer.exe` to establish network communication, using the asynchronous procedure call (APC) queue technique with the `NtQueueApcThread` API.
    *   **SysWOW64 Injection**: Xloader launches and injects code into an executable file in the SysWOW64 directory using Windows API functions such as `CreateProcessInternal`, `NtCreateSection`, `NtMapViewOfSection`, and `NtResumeThread`.
    *   The specific executable filenames targeted in SysWOW64 vary across samples and versions.
*   **Code Obfuscation**:
    *   **Multiple Encryption Layers**: Xloader uses custom encryption, including RC4 and adjacent byte subtraction, with additional layers in versions 6 and 7.
    *   **Main Functions**: Xloader executes three main functions, each responsible for decrypting subsequent encrypted functions.
        *   **Main Function 1**: Establishes persistence and decrypts/calls Main Function 2. It uses an egg-hunting technique to find the memory address range of encrypted code and XOR operations to evade static signature detection.
        *   **Main Function 2**: Executes the main loop for C2 communication and data theft, and decrypts/calls Main Function 3.
        *   **Main Function 3**: Decrypts a new encryption layer on top of NOPUSHEBP functions, using egg-hunting techniques to find encrypted blocks.
    *   **NOPUSHEBP Functions**: These functions have an additional encryption layer in versions 6 and 7. The decryption process involves dynamically calculated IDs and keys.
    *   **PUSHEBP Functions**: Similar to prior versions but with added complexities in version 7.5 that use XOR operations to derive the RC4 key.
    *   **API Call Encryption**: Xloader encrypts its code before calling critical APIs like `ZwSetThreadContext` involved in process injection. After the API call, the original code is decrypted again.
*   **Data Obfuscation**:
    *   **Dynamic Value Construction**: Instead of static encrypted data blocks, Xloader dynamically constructs strings, keys, seeds, and constants when needed.
    *   **String Obfuscation**: Dedicated functions build, decrypt, and return each string. Encrypted strings are pushed onto the stack, and a dynamically generated key is used to decrypt them with RC4 and subtraction.
    *   **Stack Strings**: Plaintext strings are built on the stack through NOPUSHEBP functions, which are themselves encrypted.
    *   **API Obfuscation**: CRC32 values for Windows API function names are created by specific code blocks instead of using static data blocks. These functions use XOR keys and RC4 with subtraction to decrypt the API function name's CRC32 value.
*   **NTDLL Hook Evasion**: Xloader loads a copy of ntdll and calls API functions from the copy to evade breakpoints or hooks on the original library.

### Recommendations
The source does not explicitly list recommendations; however, based on the technical details, these actions can be considered:

*   Monitor registry keys for unexpected entries in `HKCU` or `HKLM` under the `Run` or `Policies` keys.
*   Detect and block the injection of code into legitimate processes like `explorer.exe` and executables within the SysWOW64 directory.
*   Implement detection mechanisms for RC4 and byte subtraction encryption algorithms.
*   Monitor API calls such as `CreateProcessInternal`, `NtCreateSection`, `NtMapViewOfSection`, `NtResumeThread`, and `ZwSetThreadContext`.
*   Implement checks for processes loading their own copy of `ntdll.dll`.

### Hunting methods
The source does not explicitly list hunting methods; however, based on the technical details, these methods can be considered:

*   **Registry Monitoring**: Monitor for new or modified registry entries in the `Run` and `Policies` keys under `HKCU` and `HKLM` that point to executables in the %APPDATA% or %PROGRAMFILES% directories.
*   **Process Monitoring**: Track process creation events, looking for instances of process hollowing where a new process is created, and the original process is immediately terminated.
*   **API Hooking**: Implement API hooks or use existing EDR solutions to monitor calls to `NtQueueApcThread`, `CreateProcessInternal`, `NtCreateSection`, `NtMapViewOfSection`, and `NtResumeThread`.
*   **Memory Scanning**: Scan process memory for decrypted code blocks, focusing on areas where code has been recently decrypted before API calls.
*   **NTDLL Analysis**: Check for processes that load a separate copy of `ntdll.dll`. Compare the loaded copy's hash with the known good hash of the system's `ntdll.dll`.
*   **CRC32 Monitoring**: Monitor API calls and check if the CRC32 values are calculated dynamically instead of loaded from a static table.
