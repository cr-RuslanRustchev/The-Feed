## Cloud Threats on the Rise: Alert Trends Show Intensified Attacker Focus on IAM, Exfiltration
### Summary
Analysis of 2024 cloud security alert trends reveals a significant increase in attacks targeting cloud infrastructure, with a nearly fivefold rise in daily alerts by the year's end. High severity alerts, indicating successful targeting of critical cloud resources, saw the greatest increase, highlighting attackers' intensified focus on breaching cloud environments. Identity and access management (IAM) is identified as a primary target due to its role as the cloud infrastructure's defense perimeter, with attackers frequently targeting IAM tokens and credentials to gain access, move laterally, escalate privileges, and perform malicious operations. The report also notes upward trends in alerts related to suspicious cloud storage activity and remote command-line usage of serverless IAM tokens. The findings underscore the necessity of deploying Cloud Detection and Response (CDR) tools in conjunction with Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) to detect and prevent malicious runtime operations and build a robust cloud security defense. The observed trends align with an increase in vulnerability exposures due to accelerated deployments and a rise in advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks targeting cloud environments.

### Technical Details
The technical details of the analyzed cloud attack trends indicate a strong focus on **compromising identity and access management (IAM)** to gain a foothold within cloud environments. Attackers are actively targeting **IAM tokens and credentials**, recognizing their significance as the "keys to the cloud kingdom". This is evidenced by a **threefold increase in remote command-line access events utilizing IAM tokens and credentials of serverless functions**. This particular activity is critical as it can provide attackers with broader access to an organization's cloud environment. The average cloud environment saw a dramatic increase in alerts for the remote command-line usage of a serverless function IAM token, rising from two alerts in January 2024 to over 200 by December 2024.

Further technical observations include:
*   A **116% increase in IAM-based “impossible travel event” alerts**, suggesting attackers are leveraging compromised credentials from geographically disparate locations within short timeframes.
*   A **60% increase in IAM application programming interface (API) requests from outside regions for compute resources (cloud virtual machines)**, indicating potential unauthorized access and control of compute instances.
*   A **peak 45% increase in the number of cloud snapshot exports** during November 2024. This is significant because snapshots can contain sensitive data, including IAM credentials, enabling privilege escalation and lateral movement.
*   A **305% increase in the number of suspicious downloads of multiple cloud storage objects**, often triggered when a single IAM-based identity downloads a large number of storage objects rapidly, which can be indicative of ransomware or extortion attempts.

The report highlights the criticality of various cloud resources targeted by attackers:
*   **Identity and access management (IAM):** Leaked credentials can provide initial access.
*   **Storage:** Contains sensitive organizational or customer data, making it a target for exfiltration, ransomware, and extortion.
*   **Virtual machines:** Often connected to internal services, offering opportunities for lateral movement.
*   **Containers:** Exploitation of container hosts allows attackers to run malicious containers.
*   **Serverless:** Designed for specific automated tasks, unauthorized remote command-line executions are a strong indicator of compromise.

The increase in high severity alerts (235% increase in 2024) underscores that these attacks are not just probing but are successfully impacting critical cloud resources. The top high severity alerts frequently involve runtime-focused events, requiring near real-time or real-time analysis for detection. Examples include **remote command-line usage of serverless tokens**, **suspicious downloads of multiple cloud storage objects**, and **multiple cloud snapshot exports**.

Medium severity alerts also saw a significant mid-year spike, with most of the top 10 alerts detectable only through runtime protection analytics. These include **IAM identities attempting multiple denied actions**, **compute-attached identities making API calls outside their region**, **suspicious downloads from multiple storage buckets**, and **impossible travel by cloud compute identities**. These alerts often point to compromised cloud resources like Kubernetes service accounts being used maliciously from outside the cluster or the known cloud environment.

The report emphasizes the complementary roles of **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)** and **Cloud Detection and Response (CDR)** tools. CSPM tools focus on maintaining secure configurations and identifying vulnerabilities through scheduled scanning. In contrast, CDR tools provide continuous **runtime monitoring** by collecting and analyzing logs from various cloud resources to detect and prevent malicious operations as they occur. The increasing sophistication of cloud attacks necessitates the deployment of CDR tools to identify threats that bypass posture management controls.

A real-world example from a Unit 42 post highlights a ransomware and extortion campaign that harvested over 90,000 credentials, including nearly 1,200 cloud IAM credentials, from exposed environment variable files, leading to successful extortion attacks. This reinforces the critical need for robust security mechanisms, including both posture management and runtime monitoring.

### Recommendations
The report provides several recommendations for organizations to enhance their cloud security posture:
*   **Implement effective CDR runtime monitoring** across all cloud environments. This includes:
    *   Deploying CDR tools.
    *   Ensuring runtime enabled agents are active on all mission-critical cloud endpoints to monitor compute and container runtime operations.
    *   Ensuring runtime cloud audit log monitoring is enabled by CSP providers.
    *   Integrating cloud SaaS applications to collect logs from Identity Providers (IdP), CI/CD integrations, source code repositories, and ticketing platforms.
*   **Place limits on CSP regions** where compute and serverless functions are permitted to operate, as attackers commonly create resources in foreign regions for obfuscation.
*   **Identify and prevent IAM service accounts from performing operations outside their intended functions**. Implementing the principle of least privilege for IAM credentials is crucial to limit lateral movement and privilege escalation if a credential is compromised.
*   **Ensure that cloud storage versioning and encryption are enabled for all cloud storage containers**. These free configurations from major cloud providers significantly impede attackers attempting to steal sensitive information.
*   Recognize that **CDR runtime monitoring defenses are essential** to effectively combat the majority of threats targeting cloud environments.

### Hunting methods
The article does not provide specific hunting queries (Yara, Sigma, KQL, SPL or other languages). However, the detailed technical information can inform the development of hunting strategies. For instance:
*   The significant increase in **remote command-line usage of serverless IAM tokens** (alerts "Remote command line usage of serverless token" and "Remote command line usage of serverless role") suggests focusing hunting efforts on unusual command executions originating from serverless functions. Look for command history or execution logs (if available) from serverless environments that deviate from expected automated tasks.
*   The rise in **suspicious downloads of multiple cloud storage objects** (alert "An identity performed a suspicious download of multiple cloud storage objects") indicates a need to monitor access logs for unusually high download volumes from single identities within short periods. Correlate this with the type of data being accessed and the user's typical activity.
*   The increase in **cloud snapshot exports** (alert "Multiple cloud snapshots export") warrants monitoring cloud audit logs for infrequent or unauthorized snapshot creation and export events, especially to external accounts or regions.
*   **Impossible travel alerts** highlight the importance of analyzing login activity for users and service accounts, identifying logins from geographically improbable locations within short timeframes. This can be enhanced by correlating login events with resource access and API calls.
*   Monitoring **IAM API requests originating from outside expected regions** for compute resources can help identify potentially compromised compute instances being controlled externally. Analyze API call logs for unusual source IP addresses or regions making resource modification requests.

While specific queries are not provided, the observed alert trends and their descriptions in Tables 2 and 3 offer valuable insights for security teams to develop targeted hunting rules and alerts within their SIEM or cloud security platforms. The logic would involve looking for deviations from baseline behavior for the identified high and medium severity alert categories, focusing on the runtime operations associated with IAM usage, storage access, and compute resource manipulation.

## The "EventLogCrasher" 0day For Remotely Disabling Windows Event Log, And a Free Micropatch For It
### Summary
A **zero-day vulnerability**, dubbed "EventLogCrasher," allows any **authenticated user** on a Windows network, including low-privileged domain users, to **remotely crash the Windows Event Log service** on any other Windows computer, including domain controllers. The vulnerability, disclosed by security researcher Florian, stems from a flaw in how the Event Log service handles malformed `UNICODE_STRING` objects during a call to `RegisterEventSourceW`. Microsoft reportedly stated that the bug did not meet their bar for servicing and considered it a duplicate of an older, unserviced bug. The vulnerability remained unpatched by official Windows Updates for a significant period, from at least January 2024 until October 2024 for most Windows versions, with **Windows 11 24H2 being the only exception reported as patched**. Crashing the Event Log service can lead to a **denial of service for logging capabilities**, hindering intrusion detection, forensics, and compliance monitoring. While Security and System events are queued and may be logged upon service restart, Application logs and events from other sources are irrecoverably lost during the downtime. An attacker could repeatedly exploit this vulnerability to keep the logging service offline, effectively creating a period of "darkness" for security monitoring. A micropatch to address this vulnerability has been developed and made freely available by 0patch.

### Technical Details
![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-03-28_1.png>)
The "EventLogCrasher" vulnerability is triggered by sending a **malformed `UNICODE_STRING` object** to the `ElfrRegisterEventSourceW` method exposed by the **RPC-based EventLog Remoting Protocol**. The proof-of-concept (POC) crafted by Florian involves a single call to the `RegisterEventSourceW` function, which is intended to retrieve a handle to an event log on a specified computer. An application on one machine can use this function to interact with the event log service on another machine over the network.

Before the request is sent to the target system, the POC manipulates an **in-memory structure** related to the `UNICODE_STRING` object. Specifically, the **`Buffer` element** of this structure, which should point to the actual string buffer, is set to **NULL (0)**.

The vulnerability lies in the `wevtsvc!VerifyUnicodeString` function within the Windows Event Log service (`wevtsvc.dll`). This function receives a pointer to the malformed `UNICODE_STRING` structure as an argument. Due to the null `Buffer` pointer, the function attempts to **dereference a null pointer**, leading to an **unhandled access violation** and a crash of the `wevtsvc.exe` process, which hosts the Windows Event Log service.

While the Windows Event Log service is configured to **automatically restart** upon unexpected termination, it will only do so **twice** before entering a persistently stopped state. An attacker can exploit this by crashing the service three times in quick succession, ensuring that logging remains disabled.

During the service downtime, the affected system will **not write new events to the logs**, **forward events to centralized logging solutions** (like Splunk or Sumo Logic), or allow applications like Event Viewer to read existing or new events. This can severely impair security monitoring and incident response capabilities. Notably, **Application logs**, including events related to the crashing of the Event Log service itself, are **irrecoverably lost**.

Interestingly, **Security and System events** are handled differently. The system employs an **in-memory queue** to store these important events when the Event Log service is unavailable. Upon restarting the service, these queued events are typically written to the respective logs with their original timestamps. However, this queue has a **finite capacity**, and if it becomes full (indicated by Event 4612(S)), subsequent events may be discarded. Furthermore, events in the queue will be **lost if the system undergoes a non-graceful shutdown** (e.g., blue screen, power loss).

The attack **leverages the SMB protocol** over a named pipe (`\pipe\eventlog`). It **does not require any special firewall rules** to be enabled; it works with the default Windows Firewall configuration, even with the "Remote Event Log Management" rules disabled. Similarly, it **does not necessitate adding the attacker's user to the Event Log Readers group**. The attacker merely needs to be an authenticated user on the network to send SMB requests to the target machine. This broadens the potential attack surface to include almost any user within a Windows domain.

A crucial aspect of this vulnerability is its **potential for remote exploitation**. An attacker can crash the Event Log service on any Windows computer they can authenticate to on the network, including domain controllers.


### Recommendations
The primary technical recommendation provided in the article is to **deploy the free micropatch offered by 0patch**. This patch involves adding a check for the null pointer in the `wevtsvc!VerifyUnicodeString` function, preventing the subsequent null-pointer dereference and service crash. The micropatch can be applied without a system reboot using the 0patch Agent.

Other recommendations include:
*   **Monitor the status of the Windows Event Log service** on critical systems, especially domain controllers. Investigate any unexpected service stoppages.
*   If a crash is suspected, **immediately disconnect the affected machine from the network** to prevent further attacks.
*   **Manually restart the Windows Event Log service** to attempt to salvage any queued Security and System events. Observe incoming events using Event Viewer.
*   If the service continues to crash upon restart, the system may be under active attack and should remain disconnected from the network. **Inspect network traffic for incoming SMB connections to `\pipe\eventlog`** to identify potential sources of the attack.
*   Consider **restricting SMB connectivity** to critical systems if feasible, although this may impact other essential network services like file and printer sharing.

### Hunting methods
The article provides guidance for investigating potential exploitation:
*   **Monitor for Event Log service crashes.** While normal system issues can cause crashes, a sudden and repeated crashing of the service, especially across multiple systems, could indicate exploitation of this vulnerability. Note that the event of the Event Log service crashing might itself be lost in Application logs if the service doesn't restart quickly.
*   **Examine Security and System logs** after a suspected outage. Look for gaps in logging that might correlate with periods when the service was down.
*   **If the Event Log service is running again after a suspected outage, check for a large influx of older Security and System events**, which could indicate the processing of a backlog from the queue.
*   As mentioned in the recommendations, if the service is repeatedly crashing, **inspect network traffic (incoming SMB connections to `\pipe\eventlog`)** on a potentially targeted machine to identify the source of the malicious requests. Network monitoring tools could be used to filter for this specific activity.

The article **does not provide specific hunting queries** in languages like Yara, Sigma, KQL, or SPL. However, the technical details of the vulnerability (manipulated `UNICODE_STRING` in the context of `RegisterEventSourceW` calls over SMB) could potentially inform the development of more advanced network-based detection rules if more information about the specific malformed structure becomes publicly available.

## The Shelby Strategy
### Summary
The "The Shelby Strategy" report details a newly discovered malware family named **SHELBY**, which leverages **GitHub** for command-and-control (C2) and data exfiltration. The malware was identified during the analysis of a targeted phishing campaign, **REF8685**, against an **Iraqi telecommunications company**. The attack involved a phishing email containing a malicious ZIP archive that, upon execution, installs the SHELBY loader and backdoor. A significant security vulnerability exists in the malware's C2 design, as the **Personal Access Token (PAT) for the GitHub repository is embedded in the malware**, allowing anyone with access to it to potentially control infected machines. The malware employs various **anti-sandbox techniques** and **obfuscation** to evade detection. Two main components, **SHELBYLOADER** and **SHELBYC2**, were analyzed, revealing sophisticated methods for establishing persistence, gathering system information, and executing commands. The malware demonstrates ongoing development due to the presence of unused code and dynamic payload loading capabilities. The use of legitimate platforms like GitHub for C2 highlights a trend in malware development to blend in with normal network activity, making detection more challenging.

### Technical Details
![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-03-28_2.webp>)
The infection chain begins with a **phishing email** containing a ZIP archive (details.zip). Upon extraction and execution, a seemingly benign executable (JPerf-3.0.0.exe) utilizing the Inno Setup system drops several files into `%AppData%\Local\Microsoft\HTTPApi\`. These files include the malicious loader (**HTTPService.dll**), the encrypted backdoor (**HTTPApi.dll**), and a legitimate .NET executable (**Microsoft.Http.Api.exe** and its configuration file).

The **Microsoft.Http.Api.exe** is used for **DLL side-loading** of the malicious **HTTPService.dll**. Once loaded, **SHELBYLOADER** (**HTTPService.dll**) initiates communication with a private **GitHub repository** for its C2. The loader retrieves a specific value from the C2, which is then used to **decrypt the backdoor payload (HTTPApi.dll)** loaded into memory using **reflection**, thus avoiding writing to disk. Both the loader and the backdoor exhibit a low detection rate on VirusTotal at the time of analysis.

Both the loader and backdoor are **obfuscated using Obfuscar**, which employs **string encryption**. Analysts can use tools like de4dot with custom parameters (--strtyp delegate and --strtok <token>) to deobfuscate the code by replacing calls to the string decryptor function with their plaintext values.

**SHELBYLOADER** implements several **sandbox detection techniques**:
*   **WMI Query for System Information**: Queries `Win32_ComputerSystem` and checks `Manufacturer` and `Model` for strings like "VMware" or "VirtualBox".
*   **Process Enumeration**: Scans running processes for names associated with virtualization software (e.g., vmsrvc, vmtools, xenservice, vboxservice, vboxtray).
*   **File System Checks**: Looks for the presence of specific driver files related to virtualization (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\VBoxMouse.sys`).
*   **Disk Size Analysis**: Checks the size of the C: volume; if it's less than 50 GB, it's flagged as a potential sandbox.
*   **Parent Process Verification**: Verifies if the parent process is `explorer.exe`, indicating a typical user-driven execution.
*   **Sleep Time Deviation Detection**: Measures the execution time of `Thread.Sleep(500)` to detect if the sleep duration is being accelerated.
*   **WMI Query for Video Controller**: Queries `Win32_VideoController` and checks the `Name` for indicators of virtual hardware (e.g., "virtual", "vmware", "vbox").

The loader initializes variables including a **GitHub account name ("johnshelllby")**, a **private repository name ("myToken")**, and a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**. It sets up two timers. The first timer, triggered after 125 seconds, establishes **persistence** by adding an entry to the `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` registry key, setting the value "MicrosoftWebAppi" to point to the malware's executable. The success or failure of this operation is reported back to the C2.

The second timer, triggered after 65 seconds, is responsible for loading the backdoor. It generates a unique identifier for the infected machine by creating an **MD5 hash** of the following system information concatenated with slashes: number of processors, machine name, user domain name, username, and the number of logical drives. A subset of this hash is used as the unique identifier.

The loader then pushes a new commit to the "myToken" repository, creating a directory named after the unique identifier containing an `Info.txt` file. This file includes the domain name, username, sandbox detection results, persistence flag, and a timestamp. The malware first attempts to push the commit without a proxy and then falls back to using the system-configured proxy if the initial attempt fails.

After the initial beaconing, the loader attempts to download a file named `License.txt` from the same GitHub repository directory. If present, this 48-byte value is used to generate an **AES decryption key and Initialization Vector (IV)**. The 48-byte value is hashed using **SHA256**, with the resulting hash used as the key and the first 16 bytes as the IV. This key and IV are used to decrypt the `HTTPApi.dll` (SHELBYC2). The decrypted backdoor is then loaded into memory using `Assembly.Load`.

Another variant of **SHELBYLOADER** uses a **DNS-based keying mechanism**. It performs the same anti-sandboxing checks and registers with the C2 by building a subdomain under `arthurshelby.click` containing a static string, the Base32 encoded unique identifier, and Base32 encoded system information and anti-sandbox results. Subsequently, it performs multiple DNS queries to subdomains of `arthurshelby.click` (e.g., `l1.<unique_id>.arthurshelby.click`), and the concatenated IP addresses from these queries form the byte sequence used to generate the AES key and IV.

The **SHELBYC2** backdoor regenerates the unique identifier and creates a **Mutex** named `Global\GHS<unique_identifier>` to ensure single instance execution. After 65 seconds, it collects system information (user identity, OS version, process ID, machine name, current working directory), although this information is currently not used or exfiltrated. It then uploads the current timestamp to a file named `Vivante.txt` in the GitHub repository as a heartbeat.

The backdoor checks for commands in `Command.txt` within its unique directory and then in `Broadcast.txt` outside its directory for global commands. Handled commands include:
*   **/download**: Downloads a file from the GitHub repository to the infected machine, requiring the file name and the local save path as parameters.
*   **/upload**: Uploads a file from the infected machine to the GitHub repository, taking the local file path as a parameter. The uploaded file is named using the original file name without extension, the current date and time, and the original extension.
*   **/dlextract**: Downloads a ZIP file from the GitHub repository and extracts its contents to a specified directory.
*   **/evoke**: Reflectively loads a downloaded AES-encrypted .NET binary, requiring the local path to the binary and a value to derive the AES key and IV.

Any command not starting with these handled commands is treated as a **PowerShell command** and executed using `PowerShellProcessInstance`.

Communication with GitHub is done via crafted **HTTPS requests** to the GitHub API, not using the Git tool. Commits are sent as JSON objects with "message", base64 encoded "content", and "sha". Specific HTTP headers are used, including `Authorization: token <PAT_token>`, which is embedded in the binary. The API endpoint used is `https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/<unique identifier>/<file>`. This reliance on a hardcoded PAT is a critical flaw, allowing unauthorized control of infected machines.

### Countries
Iraq, United Arab Emirates (specifically Sharjah).

### Industries
Telecommunications, Aviation (Air Freight).

### Recommendations
The report does not explicitly provide technical recommendations for defense. However, based on the analysis, the following can be inferred:
*   **Monitor network traffic for connections to GitHub** that are not associated with legitimate Git usage, especially involving non-standard user agents and API endpoints related to content creation or modification.
*   **Inspect running processes for instances of `Microsoft.Http.Api.exe`** that have loaded unusual DLLs (specifically `HTTPService.dll`).
*   **Monitor for the creation of files in `%AppData%\Local\Microsoft\HTTPApi\`** with the names `HTTPApi.dll`, `HTTPService.dll`, and `Microsoft.Http.Api.exe`.
*   **Detect registry modifications** under `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` adding an entry for `MicrosoftWebAppi` pointing to a location within the user's AppData directory.
*   **Implement robust email security measures** to prevent phishing emails, especially those with ZIP attachments containing executables, from reaching end-users.
*   **Educate employees** about the risks of opening unsolicited attachments, even if they appear to be from internal sources.
*   **Consider blocking or monitoring connections to known malicious domains** associated with this campaign.
*   **Organizations using GitHub for legitimate purposes should ensure their PATs are securely managed** and not exposed within applications deployed to untrusted environments.

### Hunting methods

  condition:
    all of them
}
```

**Logic of the YARA rules:**
*   **Windows\_Trojan\_ShelbyLoader**: This rule looks for specific strings found within the SHELBYLOADER malware. The `$a*` strings target log messages related to sandbox detection and parent process checks. The `$b*` strings target patterns indicative of the malware's communication with the GitHub API for content upload and retrieval (JSON structure with "content" and "sha" fields) and the persistence mechanism ("Persist ID:") and the GitHub API base URL. The condition `all of ($a*) or all of ($b*)` means the rule will trigger if all of the `$a` strings are found, or if all of the `$b` strings are found.
*   **Windows\_Trojan\_ShelbyC2**: This rule targets the SHELBYC2 backdoor. The `$a*` strings look for specific command handling strings ("File Uploaded Successfully", "/dlextract", "/evoke"). The `$a4` and `$a5` strings look for patterns within JSON structures used for communication with the GitHub API, specifically the "sha" field. The condition `all of them` means all defined strings within the rule must be present for a match.

## VanHelsing, new RaaS in Town
### Summary
VanHelsingRaaS is a newly emerged and rapidly expanding ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliate program that was launched on March 7, 2025. This program operates on a revenue-sharing model where affiliates, after paying a $5,000 deposit for new members (reputable affiliates can join for free), retain 80% of the ransom payments, while the core operators receive the remaining 20%. A critical operational rule is the strict prohibition of targeting systems located within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The RaaS offers a cross-platform ransomware locker, named VanHelsing, capable of targeting a wide array of operating systems beyond Windows, including Linux, BSD, ARM, and ESXi systems. Affiliates are provided with an intuitive control panel to streamline the management and execution of ransomware attacks. Within the initial two weeks of its appearance in the cybercrime community, VanHelsingRaaS has already been linked to three successful infections, demanding substantial ransom payments, exemplified by a $500,000 demand in one instance, payable in Bitcoin. The rapid development and deployment of this RaaS indicate a significant and evolving threat in the ransomware landscape.

### Technical Details
VanHelsing Ransomware, the locker associated with the RaaS, was first observed on March 16, 2025. It is developed in **C++**. The ransomware is designed to operate across multiple platforms, as advertised by the RaaS, targeting **Windows, Linux, BSD, ARM, and ESXi systems**. Two Windows-targeting variants were identified by Check Point Research, compiled just five days apart (March 11th and March 16th, 2025), with the newer version showing significant updates and the introduction of new command-line arguments and features, indicating active development.

The ransomware supports a variety of **command-line arguments** that allow attackers to customize the encryption process. These arguments control aspects such as targeting specific drives, directories, or files (`--Driver`, `--Directory`, `--File`), execution parameters (`--Force` to allow multiple instances, `--no-priority` to avoid increasing process priority, `--Silent` for silent mode), stealth features (`--no-wallpaper`, `--no-logs`), scope of encryption (`--no-local`, `--no-mounted`, `--no-network`), privilege requirements (`--no-admin`), and potential spreading mechanisms (`--spread-smb`, `--spread-vcenter` - not yet implemented). There are also unimplemented arguments like `--no-autostart` and `--system`.

To hinder data recovery, the ransomware attempts to **delete shadow copies** using the **Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)**. This process involves initializing the **Component Object Model (COM)** using `CoInitializeEx` and `CoInitializeSecurity`, determining the system architecture, and creating a COM object instance via `CoCreateInstance`. It then connects to the `ROOT\CIMV2` namespace and executes a **WMI query** to retrieve and subsequently delete all shadow copies using the `Win32_ShadowCopy` class.

For **local drive enumeration**, the ransomware uses the `GetLogicalDriveStringsW` function to identify valid drives on the system and then selects only fixed local drives and optionally mounted drives for encryption, depending on the presence of the `--no-mounted` argument.

The ransomware employs a **blacklist** to exclude certain files, folders, and file extensions from encryption to avoid rendering the system inoperable. Excluded folders include common system and application directories like "tmp", "winnt", "temp", "Windows", "Program Files", etc.. Excluded file extensions and files include critical system files and executables such as ".exe", ".dll", ".sys", as well as the ransom note itself ("README.txt") and others. Notably, there is a flaw in the blacklist where ".vanlocker" is mistakenly excluded instead of the actual encrypted file extension ".vanhelsing".

**Network drive enumeration** is performed by default in a separate thread, unless the `--no-network` argument is used. The ransomware retrieves the local hostname and IP address and then scans a range of IP addresses on the local network (1-255) for open **SMB port 445**. For each identified SMB server, it uses `NetShareEnum` to access shared resources and proceeds with folder and file enumeration and encryption. In **"Silent" mode**, files on network shares are encrypted without the ".vanhelsing" extension being added.

The ransomware possesses **SMB spreading capabilities** activated by the `--spread-smb` argument. It drops an embedded **psexec.exe** binary into the Temp folder. It then scans for writable SMB shares, excluding those containing "NETLOGON" or "sysvol" to avoid disrupting user authentication. The ransomware copies itself as `$SHARE\\vanlocker.exe` to the network share and uses `psexec.exe` to execute it remotely with the arguments `--no-mounted` and `--no-network`, ensuring the copied instance encrypts the share without further lateral movement.

**Silent encryption mode**, triggered by the `--Silent` command-line argument, is a two-stage process designed for evasion. In the first stage ("Normal"), the ransomware encrypts files but skips renaming them. In the second stage ("Silent"), it re-enumerates the files and folders solely to rename the encrypted files by adding the ".vanhelsing" extension.

**File encryption** involves the use of the **Curve25519** public key, which is embedded in the ransomware. For each file, it generates a 32-byte key and a 12-byte nonce, which are then used with the **ChaCha20** algorithm for encryption. These ephemeral key and nonce are subsequently encrypted using the embedded Curve25519 public key and stored in hexadecimal format at the beginning of the encrypted file. The structure of an encrypted file is: `---key---$KEY_HEX---endkey------nonce---$NONCE_HEX---endnonce--$ENCRYPTED_CHUNKS`. For files larger than approximately 1GB, only the first 30% of the content is encrypted in roughly 1MB chunks. The ".vanhelsing" extension is added immediately unless the `--Silent` flag is set, in which case it's added in the second "Silent" stage.

The ransomware executable contains a **PDB file path**: `C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\2\cd9563b4cbc415b3920633b93c0d351b\1-locker\Release\1-locker.pdb`, which provides information about the development environment and could potentially link to other projects by the same author. A second, ineffective loader variant was also discovered based on its PDB path, compiled on March 11, 2025. The ransomware drops a ransom note named **README.txt** in each enumerated folder. This note informs victims about the breach and encryption of their data, demands Bitcoin for file restoration, warns against using third-party decryptors, and provides Tor links for contacting the attackers along with a unique ticket ID. The ransomware also drops two embedded images in the `C:\Windows\Web` folder: `vhlocker.png` to set as the desktop background (displaying the RaaS logo) and `vhlocker.ico`, intended to be associated with the encrypted ".vanlocker" files (note the extension mismatch). The ransomware attempts to create a mutex named **“Global\VanHelsing”** to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously, unless the `--Force` flag is used.

### Countries
Targeted Countries: All countries except those in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).

### Industries
Targeted Industries: No specific industries are mentioned in the sources.

### Recommendations
Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide comprehensive coverage of attack tactics, file types, and operating systems and protect against the attacks and threats described in this report. Specific protections mentioned include:
* Ransomware.Win.FilesMovedOrOverwrites.A
* Ransomware.Win.TouchTrapFiles.A
* TS_Ransomware.Win.FilesMovedOrOverwrites.A
* Trojan.Win.Krap.gl.D
* Trojan.Wins.Imphash.taim.XT
* Trojan.Wins.PDB.tapd.ON

### Hunting methods
* **Mutex Detection:** Monitor for the creation of the mutex **“Global\VanHelsing”**. The presence of this mutex might indicate an active or failed attempt to execute the VanHelsing ransomware (unless the `--Force` argument is used).
* **File System Monitoring:** Look for the creation of files named **README.txt** in multiple directories shortly after potential intrusion activity. This is the standard ransom note dropped by VanHelsing.
* **Desktop Background Changes:** Detect changes in the desktop background to an image named **vhlocker.png** in the `C:\Windows\Web` folder.
* **Encrypted File Extension:** Monitor for the creation of files with the **.vanhelsing** extension across the file system.
* **Icon File Association:** Although flawed, detection of the file **vhlocker.ico** being dropped in `C:\Windows\Web` could be an indicator. However, note the mismatch with the actual encrypted file extension.
* **PDB Path in Memory or on Disk:** While more challenging to detect in real-time, if the ransomware executable is captured, the presence of the PDB file path `C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\2\cd9563b4cbc415b3920633b93c0d351b\1-locker\Release\1-locker.pdb` within the binary can be a strong indicator.
* **SMB Activity:** Monitor for unusual SMB traffic patterns, particularly attempts to connect to port 445 from multiple internal hosts, which could indicate the network scanning phase. Also, look for the dropping and execution of `vanlocker.exe` or `psexec.exe` on network shares.
* **Shadow Copy Deletion:** Investigate suspicious processes invoking WMI commands to delete shadow copies (`wmic.exe shadowcopy delete`).

## You will always remember this as the day you finally caught FamousSparrow
### Summmary
ESET Research has uncovered a resurgence of activity from the China-aligned Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group **FamousSparrow** in July 2024. Previously thought to be inactive since 2022, the group targeted a **trade group in the financial sector in the United States** and a **research institute in Mexico**. This campaign revealed significant advancements in FamousSparrow's toolset, most notably **two previously undocumented versions of their flagship SparrowDoor backdoor**. One new version of SparrowDoor showed similarities to the CrowDoor backdoor attributed to Earth Estries, while the other is a **modular variant** with a significantly different architecture. This campaign also marks the **first documented use of the ShadowPad backdoor** by FamousSparrow. Further investigation revealed additional targeting of a **governmental institution in Honduras** between 2022 and 2024. The analysis indicates that FamousSparrow has been actively developing its tools during its presumed inactivity. The report also discusses the ongoing debate and differing opinions among security researchers regarding the potential links between FamousSparrow and other threat actors like Salt Typhoon and GhostEmperor.

### Technical Details
![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-03-28_3.png>)
The observed attack chain began with **initial access likely gained through the exploitation of a vulnerability in outdated versions of Windows Server and Microsoft Exchange**. The attackers deployed **webshells on an IIS server**. A **batch script** was used to download and deploy a **DotNetNuke webshell**. This webshell communicated using **AES encryption** with a hardcoded key `e2c99096bcecd1b5`. The webshell was used to **spawn an interactive remote PowerShell session**.

Following initial access, the threat actor performed reconnaissance using legitimate Windows tools and the **PowerHub** post-exploitation framework. They employed the **BadPotato privilege-escalation technique** (specifically the open-source `Invoke-BadPotato` module added to PowerHub) to achieve **SYSTEM privileges**.

The attackers then deployed **SparrowDoor** using a **trident loader scheme** similar to one documented by the UK NCSC in 2022. This involved three files: a legitimate version of **K7AntiVirus Messenger Scanner (K7AVMScn.exe)** for DLL side-loading, a malicious DLL named **K7AVWScn.dll**, and an encrypted payload file **K7AVWScn.doc**. The payload was encrypted using **RC4**, with the key hardcoded in both the loader and the payload. The decrypted payload contained a custom configuration and reflective loader shellcode. The **C&C server configuration** was located in the last 202 bytes of the payload, encrypted with the same **RC4 key**. This configuration consisted of three C&C server addresses and ports, followed by a retry interval.

The first new version of SparrowDoor exhibited **improved code quality and architecture**, including **parallelization of time-consuming commands** like file I/O and the interactive shell. It uses an integer value from the registry (`HKLM\Software\CLASSES\CLSID\ID` or `HKCU\Software\CLASSES\CLSID\ID`) as a victim identifier. Network communication used a base packet format with a command ID and data length.

Key command-line arguments for this SparrowDoor version included executing without arguments to establish persistence (via a service named `K7Soft` or a registry Run key), `11` for process hollowing of `colorcpl.exe` and loader injection, and `22` for main backdoor operation. The backdoor attempts to terminate other running instances by checking for the existence of a mutex named `Global\ID()` using process IDs.

Notable commands supported by this SparrowDoor version include:
*   `0x32341122`: Initial connection.
*   `0x32341123`: Send host information (IP, ID, OS details, computer name, username).
*   `0x32341124`: Start interactive shell session (parallel) using named pipes `\\.\pipe\id2` (commands to shell) and `\\.\pipe\id1` (shell output). Commands and output use ID `0x32341126`.
*   `0x32341127`: Sleep and move to the next C&C server.
*   `0x32341128`: Uninstall backdoor and cleanup.
*   `0x32341129`: Get current network configuration.
*   `0x3234112A`: Set network configuration (received data is RC4 encrypted and overwrites the last 202 bytes of the payload file).
*   `0x3234112B`: Execute loader with argument 11 and terminate.
*   `0x3234112D`: File I/O (parallel) with subcommands for read (`0x3234112E`), write (`0x3234112F`), and data transfer (`0x32341130`). File reads are done in 4kB chunks. File writes only occur if the received size is greater than the existing file size.
*   `0x32341131`: Get connected drive information.
*   `0x32341132`: List files (sends an acknowledgement `0x32341133` followed by file information with ID `0x32341132` and a completion message `0x32341134`).
*   `0x32341135`: Create directory.
*   `0x32341136`: Move or rename file.
*   `0x32341137`: Delete file.
*   `0x32341138`: Start proxy (parallel, sends acknowledgement with same ID, server initiates proxy with `0x32341139`).

The second new version is a **modular SparrowDoor**, significantly different in architecture. The command header is sent separately and the body is **RC4 encrypted with the key `iotrh^%4CFGTj`**. It implements fewer built-in commands, focusing on C&C configuration management and backdoor uninstallation. Host information, including a list of installed security products, is sent automatically after the initial connection. The remaining functionality is implemented through **plugins**. Plugins are PE files sent by the C&C server and loaded in memory. They are referenced via a C++ list with a bitmask and handler function. A default plugin with bitmask `0x10000` handles the installation of new plugins. Similarities were found with **HemiGate**, which also uses plugins implemented as C++ classes.

The campaign also involved the use of **ShadowPad**, marking the first observation of this backdoor being deployed by FamousSparrow. A ShadowPad loader (DLL `imjpp14.dll`) was side-loaded by a renamed, outdated Microsoft Office IME executable (`imjp14k.exe`). The loader validates the process and decrypts `imjp14k.dll.dat` before injecting the payload into `wmplayer.exe`. An in-memory detection of ShadowPad connected to IP `216.238.106[.]150` was observed.

Other tools used during the compromise include:
*   A basic batch script to dump registry hives (HKLM\SYSTEM, HKLM\SAM, hklm\security).
*   Impacket or NetExec (detected by firewall).
*   A modified version of the open-source Spark RAT with a Go shellcode loader.
*   A tool to dump LSASS memory using the MiniDumpW API, split into two DLLs (`%HOME%\dph.dll` and `%WINDIR%\SysWOW64\msvc.dll`) and loaded via a renamed legitimate VLC Cache Generator (`dph.exe`).

The ShadowPad C&C server used a **self-signed TLS certificate** with SHA-1 fingerprint `BAED2895C80EB6E827A6D47C3DD7B8EFB61ED70B` that spoofed Dell certificates. One SparrowDoor C&C server (`45.131.179[.]24:80`) had a TLS certificate on port 443 with the same Common Name as the ShadowPad C&C server. Three unique SparrowDoor C&C servers on port 80 were identified. The modular SparrowDoor sample used `amelicen[.]com` as a C&C domain, which resolved to `45.131.179[.]24`. One SparrowDoor loader download server (`43.254.216[.]195:80`) was also used as a C&C server in the modular sample.

### Countries
*   United States
*   Mexico
*   Honduras

### Industries
*   Financial Sector (trade group)
*   Research Institute
*   Governmental Institution

### Recommendations
The source article does not explicitly list technical recommendations for defense. However, based on the TTPs observed, typical recommendations for mitigating APT threats would apply:
*   Keep operating systems and software, especially internet-facing applications like Microsoft Exchange and IIS servers, up to date with the latest security patches.
*   Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication to protect domain accounts.
*   Monitor network traffic for suspicious connections and command-and-control activity, particularly to the identified IOCs.
*   Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect and block malicious activities, including process injection, DLL side-loading, and suspicious PowerShell usage.
*   Monitor for the creation of unusual services or registry Run keys for persistence.
*   Be vigilant for the execution of legitimate tools like `certutil.exe`, `reg.exe`, `wmic.exe`, `net.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and PowerShell in unusual contexts.
*   Inspect the `HKLM\Software\CLASSES\CLSID\` and `HKCU\Software\CLASSES\CLSID\` registry hives for keys with non-standard names.
*   Monitor for the use of open-source tools like PowerHub and Spark RAT, especially if they are modified.
*   Detect and block known ShadowPad infrastructure and loaders.

### Hunting methods
The article mentions several indicators and techniques that can be used for threat hunting:
*   **Unusual registry keys:** Hunting for non-standard named keys under `Software\Classes\CLSID\` in both `HKLM` and `HKCU` hives can identify potential SparrowDoor activity.
    ```
    // Example pseudo-query
    Registry Hive: HKLM OR HKCU
    Path: Software\Classes\CLSID\
    Description: Look for registry keys under CLSID that do not conform to the GUID format (i.e., not enclosed in curly brackets).
    ```
*   **Process hollowing of colorcpl.exe:** Monitoring for `colorcpl.exe` being launched with the command-line argument `22` followed by injection of a suspicious module could indicate SparrowDoor execution.
    ```
    // Example pseudo-query
    Process Name: colorcpl.exe
    Command Line: * 22
    Description: Investigate if this process is followed by suspicious DLL injection or network activity.
    ```
*   **Mutex creation pattern:** Detecting the creation of mutexes with the name `Global\ID(<PID>)` where `<PID>` is the process ID of running processes, especially if followed by process termination, could indicate SparrowDoor attempting to kill other instances.
    ```
    // Example pseudo-query
    Mutex Name: Global\ID(*)
    Description: Correlate mutex creation with subsequent process termination events, excluding known legitimate patterns.
    ```
*   **Network connections on port 80:** Monitor connections to the identified SparrowDoor C&C IPs on port 80.
    ```
    // Example pseudo-query
    Network Destination IP: 43.254.216[.]195 OR 45.131.179[.]24 OR 103.85.25[.]166
    Network Destination Port: 80
    Protocol: TCP
    Description: Investigate traffic to these known FamousSparrow C&C servers.
    ```
*   **ShadowPad loader side-loading:** Look for the execution of `imecmnt.exe` (renamed to `imjp14k.exe`) loading `imjpp14.dll`. Also monitor for `wmplayer.exe` being spawned by `imjp14k.exe` and connecting to `216.238.106[.]150`.
    ```
    // Example pseudo-query
    Process Name: imjp14k.exe
    Loaded DLL: imjpp14.dll
    Description: Investigate instances of this DLL being loaded by the renamed IME executable.

    Process Name: wmplayer.exe
    Parent Process Name: imjp14k.exe
    Network Destination IP: 216.238.106[.]150
    Protocol: TCP
    Description: Look for Windows Media Player processes spawned by the renamed IME executable connecting to the ShadowPad C&C server.
    ```
*   **LSASS memory dumping:** Monitor for the execution of `dph.exe` loading `msvc.dll` from `SysWOW64`, which could be indicative of the custom LSASS dumping tool.
    ```
    // Example pseudo-query
    Process Name: dph.exe
    Loaded DLL: %WINDIR%\SysWOW64\msvc.dll
    Description: Investigate instances of dph.exe loading this specific DLL, especially if `dph.exe` is a renamed VLC cache generator.
    ```
